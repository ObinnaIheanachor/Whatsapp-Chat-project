11/15/19, 07:06 - AcidiQ: Good morning Fam.
I just went through the Budget project workflow on the Resagratia website, it's really awesome and inspiring.
It's great to be here.
11/15/19, 07:29 - +234 805 230 5080: Sounds great
11/15/19, 08:09 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Pleasure to have you join us
11/15/19, 08:32 - AcidiQ: Thank you Boss.
I've accessed the Doc file. Hope I'm free to work on any Ministry and extract relevant data?
11/15/19, 08:34 - +234 907 199 5587: Good morning data fellows, can anyone please share the framework/template you're using to input the extracted data so someone don't do something else, thanks.
11/15/19, 08:40 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yes. Any MDA that is left *Open* can be worked on.
11/15/19, 08:42 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Do you mean the function that is used to extract the structured data? 

The tutorial for that is ongoing and should be available latest tomorrow.

The way the output should look has been covered in Tutorial 1.
11/15/19, 08:42 - AcidiQ: Ok, great.

11/15/19, 10:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: There's a collaboration spreadsheet available, you should work on only Ministries that are *open*. once you decide on a ministry to work on, change the staus field to "In-progress" and add your name as the collaborator

11/18/19, 09:14 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Good morning tribe,

The third tutorial is finally available and those that are itching to try their hands on generating *expenditure and capital projects functions* should take a look at this: 

bit.ly/2rUMchZ

The group description has been modified to contain the process you can follow, with detailed tutorials that'll empower you to be a contributor, especially in the data engineering aspect.

When we have successfully extracted the 48 MDAs, the data will be hosted online for everyone to visualise and analyse. 

A complete data model will be created and the schema will be generated. It is through these that we hope to decipher any *sharing formula*. In this regard, contributors are welcome as well, including writers, analysts and visual experts.
11/18/19, 09:17 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: If you're going through the tutorials, don't forget to reach out to any of the contributors if you encounter errors in your functions. 

Please if you're currently working on any extractions, let's quickly identify ourselves by a show of hands 🙋🏽‍♂🙋🏽
11/18/19, 09:22 - AcidiQ: 🙋🏾‍♂ Federal Ministry of Police Affairs.
Almost complete
11/18/19, 09:26 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Nice. Well done!😁
11/18/19, 10:06 - Richie: 🙋🏾‍♂ Trade and investment
11/18/19, 10:07 - Richie: Almost done extracted the pdf and splitted currently on the last step
11/18/19, 11:36 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Great stuff! Tutorial 3 next 💪🏽
11/18/19, 13:34 - +234 903 881 9790: 🙋🏾‍♂ Department of Petroleum Resources
11/18/19, 13:36 - +234 806 351 4863: 😱😱Guy na this MDA I don dey work on oo
11/18/19, 13:41 - +234 903 881 9790: ☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
11/18/19, 13:42 - +234 903 881 9790: If you have started earlier before this time I will gladly swerve for you
11/18/19, 14:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Kindly confirm available MDAs on the progress worksheet

11/18/19, 15:05 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: So guys, I did a quick rough analysis of the project
11/18/19, 15:05 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 15:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
11/18/19, 15:09 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: The capital project function has been explained, you can use this link to follow through http://bit.ly/2rUMchZ

For the guys that have sent copies of expenditures, you can work on the capital projects of the same MDA's you started working on.. So you can turn the *In-progress* into *completed* ✨
11/18/19, 15:11 - +234 806 222 9997: I have been quite busy.
Is there deadline @2348173559817 ?
The least I want to do is 2
11/18/19, 15:12 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: We hope to have finished all the transformations by this week
11/18/19, 15:15 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: So you can pick 2 MDA's you want to work on and set them to "In-progress" in the collaboration sheet. Provided you think you can finish before the week runs out
11/18/19, 15:16 - +234 806 222 9997: Okay
11/18/19, 15:16 - +234 806 222 9997: Thanks
11/18/19, 15:22 - +234 903 881 9790: Thanks Tobi.


We have discussed about it and it has been resolved.

Will start working on

 Nigeria atomic energy commission and it's center and code of conduct burea
11/18/19, 15:25 - +234 805 230 5080: When are we starting the analysis please?
11/18/19, 15:41 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Awesome stuff.
11/18/19, 15:42 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: We'll begin as soon as all extractions are done. We need to define an overall schema for the data model as we begin analysis

11/19/19, 07:08 - +234 806 222 9997: Good morning great folks.
In case you have one out of the rest you are handling, and still 'in progress' and you want to let go, kindly let me know. 
I had it in mind to pick on another this morning, only to find out all have been taken.

Just in case.
11/19/19, 07:20 - +234 806 227 6975: Please let me know the available ones so that I can pick the one to work on.
11/19/19, 07:20 - +234 805 230 5080: Alright
11/19/19, 09:13 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Good morning
11/19/19, 09:17 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Did anyone find the tutorial useful? Especially tutorial 3?

Has anyone who went through the tutorials online been able to generate the three files?

1. Summary page
2. Expenditure items and
3. Capital projects breakdown
11/19/19, 10:49 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Hey guys, please @2347069002818  the collaboration sheets says you've completed 12 MDA's, I'm yet to receive any of the final excel files from you
11/19/19, 10:50 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Please kindly send the excel files of the transformed MDA'S to john@resagratia.com
11/19/19, 10:57 - +234 706 900 2818: okay... I'll do that 
thanks
11/19/19, 10:57 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Please, as soon as possible
11/19/19, 10:58 - +234 706 900 2818: it may take a while please, cos they are still in pdf
11/19/19, 10:59 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Have you applied the transformations with power query??
11/19/19, 11:02 - +234 706 900 2818: not yet
11/19/19, 11:16 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: The idea is to create a function from one MDA that transforms both the expenditure and capital project items into clean data, then execute these functions on all other MDA's
11/19/19, 11:16 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Please refer to this tutorial to understand how to go about creating the functions
11/19/19, 11:18 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: If you have correctly extracted the MDA's you want to work on, please chant the status on the collaboration spreadsheet to "In-progress". You can only change to complete once you have sent the transformed files in excel format
11/19/19, 11:18 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Change*
11/19/19, 11:22 - +234 706 900 2818: oh that... now i get it
11/19/19, 14:19 - +234 817 190 1732: @john 
I have sent the excel files
11/19/19, 14:22 - +234 817 190 1732: Any open MDAs to work on
11/19/19, 14:23 - +234 817 190 1732: Since this week is our target
11/19/19, 14:28 - +234 909 964 9854: 😢😭I am still trying to get a hold of the technique very well , will start when I am able to get a good grip
11/19/19, 14:48 - +234 817 190 1732: Tru and follow the tutorials
11/19/19, 14:48 - +234 817 190 1732: If you have any difficulty you can always ask
11/19/19, 15:54 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: ✨✨✨
11/19/19, 15:55 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: can @2347069002818  kindly set some of the MDAs as open please
11/19/19, 16:00 - +234 706 900 2818: okay, that will be fine
11/19/19, 16:02 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Ok thanks
11/19/19, 16:02 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Kayode you can take note of this
11/19/19, 16:04 - +234 706 900 2818: done
11/19/19, 16:04 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Niceee
11/19/19, 16:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Guy who still want to work on some MDAs should take note.. some are open now
11/19/19, 16:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Our deadly is Thursday please
11/19/19, 16:12 - +234 806 489 8353: I want to work on the extracted file as a data analyst as I was not in the previous class .
11/19/19, 16:13 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: No problem, it's fine
11/19/19, 16:13 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: once we're done, you can start doing analysis
11/19/19, 16:15 - +234 806 489 8353: Okay, thanks John.
11/19/19, 16:34 - +234 817 190 1732: Okay
11/19/19, 17:13 - +234 806 227 6975: I want to but I don’t no the available ones.
11/19/19, 17:24 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: you can see this on the collaboration sheet
11/19/19, 17:24 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EsaZP2_6UGbpa1XZ4vkl0Oal9Wm-tuQYVHKNFjFnnKE/edit#gid=1133657179
11/19/19, 18:22 - +234 806 351 4863: Done
11/19/19, 18:24 - +234 806 351 4863: Hope so, but will start it soon. Have sent my extracted files.

@2348062991199 please is there any deadline on the transformations using powerBI?
11/19/19, 18:37 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Okay great. Niice 💪🏽

Thursday please.
11/19/19, 18:37 - +234 806 351 4863: This Thursday??
11/19/19, 18:41 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: The data engineering aspect is almost completed. The remaining MDAs will not require as much time to split the documents. So let's try to get that aspect out of the way latest this Thursday.

Of course anyone can still continue practicing with the data, however, submissions for the remaining MDAs should come in by Thursday latest.
11/19/19, 18:45 - +234 806 351 4863: Am trying to get you clearly, I have sent my extracted excel files

The after doing the data cleaning on powerBI, what next?
11/19/19, 18:49 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Then we will combine everything together, and share a link for anyone to connect to. A schema will be generated, which will enable us create a better data model.

Data analysts and visual gurus would then be able to play around with the data effectively
11/19/19, 19:37 - +234 817 190 1732: That's good
11/19/19, 19:39 - +234 806 351 4863: Good
11/19/19, 21:28 - +234 806 227 6975: Thanks.
11/20/19, 11:04 - +234 706 900 2818: @2348173559817 ,hope you got the files I sent this morning
11/20/19, 11:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Yes, I received them
11/20/19, 11:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I'm going through them now
11/20/19, 11:07 - +234 706 900 2818: okay
11/20/19, 11:08 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 👍
11/20/19, 11:23 - AcidiQ: Pls how does one circumvent the PowerBi sign up procedure? 
It's requesting for a work or student email
11/20/19, 11:29 - +234 813 687 5225: Is it BI desktop you downloaded?
11/20/19, 11:29 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: You don't need to sign up. Just click to sign in, then close the sign in dialog box that appears.
11/20/19, 11:30 - AcidiQ: Yes
11/20/19, 11:30 - AcidiQ: Ok, thank you Boss
11/20/19, 11:30 - +234 813 687 5225: Yelp..... It's been answered already
11/20/19, 13:17 - +234 806 351 4863: Hi @2348062991199  the videos aren't very clear, couldn't see clearly the things you clicked on.  Can you share a better one? Was forcing my eyes to see the points you clicked at
11/20/19, 13:24 - AcidiQ: In the first video, why was the 3rd file selected?

Are we to repeat the process for all the sub-MDAs?
11/20/19, 13:39 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Hi, can I know which aspects you couldn't see clearly? I may be able to work you through it remotely.

If you're on mobile, it might be more difficult to follow through. Try fullscreen, landscape and pause at any point, if that helps.
11/20/19, 13:46 - +234 806 351 4863: am using my phone, because i cant connect my phone to the laptop as i have small MB to use on laptop and my office internet doesnt accept youtube videos
11/20/19, 13:50 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: In the first video in Part 3 of the series?

That video went through how to create steps 1 to 3:
1. Identify and create a sample file (binary)
2. Parametise the sample file as binary
3. Create a reference to the parameter to serve as the function file

We used a particular sub-MDA as a sample file - National Rural Electrification Agency. We recommend using this one because the transformations that you'll apply will make the function very robust.
11/20/19, 13:54 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Ah I see. The video quality reaches 720p which is HD, so I'm guessing you've been viewing a lower quality version. The video is actually large and you would require some data either way. Can your office internet download video from another site so you can watch for later?

If yes, I suggest you use https://y2mate.io/ to download the HD version and watch later.
11/20/19, 13:55 - AcidiQ: Looks like I'm missing something.

I didn't actually extract the Ministry of Power file. I just followed the steps in extracting the MDA's that I'm working on.

Will I have to extract the specific files that were used in the tutorial then apply the functions to my extracted MDAs?
11/20/19, 13:56 - +234 806 222 9997: The video is actually very very fantastic 👌
My opinion though.
11/20/19, 13:58 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yes. The tutorials will allow you create two functions to extract expenditure items and capital projects breakdown using the data from the Ministry of Power.

When these functions have been created, you can then extract an MDA you're working on and invoke the functions on them to automatically extract their data.

The tutorials on the Ministry of Power will allow you create a template that can be used for others.
11/20/19, 14:01 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Thanks a lot for the feedback. I'm glad you found it useful
11/20/19, 14:05 - AcidiQ: Ok, great. Thank you for the insight.
Let me get to work.
11/20/19, 14:17 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 👍🏽
11/21/19, 08:34 - AcidiQ: <Media omitted>
11/21/19, 08:56 - +234 706 900 2818: You can go this way:
close and apply the query.
Then go to Data view, right click on a table and choose the option: copy table.
Then go excel sheet and paste

Do same for the other 2 tables as well
11/21/19, 09:16 - AcidiQ: Thanks a bunch bro. This was very helpful.
11/21/19, 09:07 - +234 806 079 8098: I can still work on any two MDAs that are in progress
11/21/19, 09:08 - +234 806 079 8098: @all, If u have in progress in any of the mda. Pls let me know the one I can work it
11/21/19, 09:10 - +234 806 079 8098: @2348173559817 pls help check through the worksheet and speak to anyone that still have in progress. For like 2, I can still work on.... Thanks!!!
11/21/19, 09:13 - Opeyemi Tosin: Could you also provide an update on the list of completed and submitted MDAs?
11/21/19, 09:15 - +234 706 900 2818: @2348060798098 ,i have made national assembly open. You can work on that
11/21/19, 09:16 - +234 806 079 8098: Alright.. Thanks
11/21/19, 09:16 - AcidiQ: I'm also open to any free MDA
11/21/19, 09:20 - Opeyemi Tosin: Guys help a brother biko 🙌🏿 I need an MDA to work on. Hope the deadline will extend to 11:59pm today? 🙈
11/21/19, 09:24 - +234 706 900 2818: You are welcome
11/21/19, 09:25 - AcidiQ: @2348173559817 Judiciary MDA has just two pages. Does this explain why the expenditure custom function is giving an error feedback.

What's the best way to approach this.
11/21/19, 10:35 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I'll have a look at this
11/21/19, 10:36 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Did you split this correctly
11/21/19, 10:37 - AcidiQ: It has just two pages, one MDA and zero capital projects
11/21/19, 10:37 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: ✨✨ refer to this if you need your extracted files in excel format
11/21/19, 10:37 - AcidiQ: I'm thinking of doing it manually.
11/21/19, 10:38 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Ok, I'll see to this soonest
11/21/19, 10:38 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Hold on, I'll have a look at it now
11/21/19, 10:42 - AcidiQ: Okay
11/21/19, 10:57 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Ok, so they're two pages for judiciary
11/21/19, 10:57 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: You should split them into two then. Summary and Expenditure
11/21/19, 10:58 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Run the function on the expenditure and even capital.. although you won't have any data for capital projects, it's fine that way
11/21/19, 10:59 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Just make sure to send an excel file containing the summary and the expenditures
11/21/19, 11:05 - AcidiQ: That's my complaint. The expenditure function returns error feedback.

It worked well on for my first MDA.

Kindly check the screenshots I DM'd you
11/21/19, 11:22 - +234 806 222 9997: Code of conduct is opened now. It was giving me reduced number of capital projects than supposed eventually I found out that the reason for it was the overflowing description of the project name. I would have tried further to find way to do it eventually, but an official assignment is on me to finish, thus I wouldn't want to delay it further. It is opened on the list
11/21/19, 11:22 - AcidiQ: I just took it. Let me see if I can resolve the issue.
11/21/19, 11:23 - Opeyemi Tosin: 😳  that's fast...
11/21/19, 11:24 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 😂😂
11/21/19, 11:24 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: That's the spirit guys
11/21/19, 11:25 - AcidiQ: 😁
11/21/19, 11:25 - AcidiQ: 💪🏽
11/21/19, 11:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 75% completed now
11/21/19, 11:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Guys turn in your work before end of day please 🙏🏼
11/21/19, 11:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 💪🏼
11/21/19, 11:30 - +234 806 079 8098: @2348110895622 u can take this

11/21/19, 18:03 - +234 806 222 9997: Ooooh!
I just dealt with a similar thing few hours ago.
Not hard.
There could be a number of ways to go about it.
One way is to split that column with the space condition (you may choose every space, if the digits are into 6 or more)  as the thing to look for. Then after splitting, merge them again with nothing as condition to join them in between. That way, the space would have gone.

However make sure that the column you select first is the one that should start your actual number, or in that sequence if the result splits are more than 2.
After merging, then change data type to whole number or decimal as you might want.
The error is occurring because of how the data was structured from when and/or where imported...which is the space in between them.
11/21/19, 18:03 - +234 806 222 9997: Hope it's a bit clear?!
Revert if not.
Thanks
11/21/19, 18:08 - +234 706 900 2818: okay, much thanks... i'll try it
11/21/19, 19:47 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Thank you for this.

In addition, after promoting a row to become the header for the dataset, Power BI automatically adds a query which you can see as "Changed Type". You should delete that query from the *Applied steps* pane to prevent automatic formatting into text. 

Try if that helps.
11/21/19, 20:59 - +234 706 900 2818: @2348062229997, this worked perfectly fine.
Much thanks. I'm very grateful for that help
11/21/19, 21:01 - +234 706 900 2818: Yeah, I get this too, the challenge is that, the data was formatted like that from source. It's a bank statement. 
Thank you @2348062991199 for your assistance as well
11/21/19, 21:05 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Splendid!
11/21/19, 21:18 - +234 706 900 2818: That automatic "changed type" can be annoying. If not removed, results in data loss.
11/21/19, 21:32 - +234 806 222 9997: 👍
11/21/19, 21:33 - +234 806 222 9997: Even removing 'changed type' never did mine too, so I had to implement that. Pquery is as powerful as your imagination can carry you.
11/21/19, 21:34 - +234 806 222 9997: You are welcome @2347069002818
11/21/19, 21:37 - +234 706 900 2818: Very very. I was just laughing at myself after implementing the steps you gave.
I was like, Wow... so easy? And it has been there all along.
11/25/19, 09:30 - +234 706 900 2818: Good morning Admin, 
I'd like to know our next line of action on the project
11/25/19, 09:34 - +234 817 190 1732: Same here
11/25/19, 09:59 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Thanks for this sodeeq
11/25/19, 10:00 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: We're hoping to have collated and hosted all of the data on google sheets by Wednesday this week
11/25/19, 10:02 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Also, there's plan for a workshop already, we'll have more information about this before the week runs out. The idea for the workshop is to strategize on how we want to approach creating visualisation for the data, learn some design techniques etc.
11/25/19, 10:03 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: After this, We'll have individuals collaborate on building dashboards and reports of their choosing before a final workshop for the year
11/25/19, 10:09 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: In the final workshop, we plan for it to be a discussion about the budget. Hopefully, by this time, senate would have signed the budget. 

We'll re-create our process, this time, using the signed budget and have each of the collaborators talk about any MDA's of their choosing and explain insights that they have uncovered. This is likely going to be in partnership with some civic organisations (more on this soonest). 

*Watch this space guys!!*
11/25/19, 10:10 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: *TLDR; Expect another workshop soonest* 😁
11/25/19, 10:12 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: We'll end the year by creating a full report of the project. All collaborators will be given credit for their participation
11/25/19, 10:13 - Richie: can the workshop be available on youtube because i will be travelling out this week pls if possible
11/25/19, 10:15 - Richie: beautiful

12/1/19, 23:04 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Glad to have you join us 😁
12/2/19, 21:52 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Good evening house

Firstly, I want to thank very much those who've contributed to this project and those who've joined us to try their hands on automation in Power BI. We have the aggregated data that will be made available on the website shortly (I'm working to get it online right now).

From this point forward, you will be able to create a nice data model, details of which I'll also include a post tomorrow. For those that understand how to generate the schema in Excel, I invite you to try to generate one from all the MDAs and begin creating some visualisations.

Also, sorry to disappoint some of you but the next workshop will on *Friday, 6th December*. *Rise Networks* has agreed to host us but this will be for Friday and it is themed: A Visual Presentation of Insights

We're hoping to generate as many insightful visuals as possible to showcase to allow us have an open discourse on the budget details. Granted most of us will be at work, but I'd appreciate if a few report contributors can be present to discuss their visuals. We want to showcase a select number of dashboards that spark some curiosity in people.
12/2/19, 21:55 - +234 907 199 5587: Thanks for the update Tobi
12/2/19, 21:58 - Richie: Interesting but will there be videos for those of us that left the state😊

12/2/19, 21:59 - +234 809 837 4664: Thanks for the update💪💪

You mean that people who will be available on that Friday will create visuals or do you mean that they are coming to explain their already created visuals?
12/2/19, 22:18 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Cheers man
12/2/19, 22:20 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Those who create visuals for the workshop should be available to discuss their visuals.
The data will be available with instructions from tomorrow for anyone to connect to.
12/2/19, 22:20 - +234 806 351 4863: Alright, thanks
12/2/19, 22:21 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I make no promises, but we'll see about this

12/3/19, 13:54 - +234 907 199 5587: 🙌🙌🙌

Thanks Tobi
12/3/19, 13:55 - +234 813 687 5225: Thanks boss
12/3/19, 14:00 - Opeyemi Tosin: Thanks Baba 🙌🏿
12/3/19, 14:00 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: You're welcome
12/3/19, 14:10 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Update: We just built the *largest set of open analytics data on Nigeria's budget!!!*

We'll be having some visualisations to spur our creativity to build even more insightful dashboards. Please pick one or two MDAs to analyse, or if you'd like, do an overall analysis that can drill down to a particular MDA.

The most important thing right now is to be visually compelling in your narrative and to have a few strong insights that people didn't know existed.

@2348173559817 is currently working on the Ministry of Education. I can tell you that before now, I didn't know some of these things about Nigeria. I really can't wait to see what you all will make out of it.

Data Visualization is a bae ❤
12/3/19, 14:22 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Quick one, is there any collaborator that I don't have on LinkedIn?
12/3/19, 14:24 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/3/19, 14:24 - Opeyemi Tosin: Maybe we should all drop our LinkedIn profileID
12/3/19, 14:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Please before this, I want to open up the last MDA. who can work on it as soon as possible and give me the extracts?
12/3/19, 14:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Any volunteers?
12/3/19, 14:27 - Opeyemi Tosin: If tonight is not too late, then I'm game
12/3/19, 14:27 - Opeyemi Tosin: It should be ready before 9am
12/3/19, 14:27 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: @2348062991199 what do you  think about this?
12/3/19, 14:27 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yeah for those that I don't have on Linkedin please. We're already connected Tosin

12/3/19, 14:28 - Opeyemi Tosin: Thanks Bro.
12/3/19, 14:31 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: You're welcome
12/3/19, 14:43 - AcidiQ: Great work Boss! 

Any templates to follow in creating the visuals?
Also can one use any viz tool or is it limited to just Power Bí?
12/3/19, 14:48 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: You can use any visualisation tool as long as you can connect to web data sources
12/3/19, 14:50 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: For Tableau, you might have to install a web data connector. 

For Power BI, it's straight forward.

For Python, you may have to do a HTTP request to import data from the web.
12/3/19, 14:53 - AcidiQ: Okay, thank you Boss. I'd love to use Power Bí but I just started learning the software. I'm more comfortable with Python.
12/3/19, 14:56 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: That's great. You can build with both tools to ensure you learn PBI on the go.
12/3/19, 15:00 - Opeyemi Tosin: You can run your python scripts inside powerbi
12/3/19, 15:01 - Opeyemi Tosin: Read more here 👇

12/3/19, 15:42 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 😂😂
12/3/19, 15:42 - Opeyemi Tosin: What determined the budget allocation for each school?
12/3/19, 15:43 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I'm guessing Thier individual requirements. Personnel costs: re: lecturers salary. 

Proposed capital projects too
12/3/19, 15:44 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: It would be interesting to find out
12/3/19, 15:44 - Opeyemi Tosin: Hmmmm 🤔
12/3/19, 15:44 - Opeyemi Tosin: Oya......
Asking questions give more insights
12/3/19, 15:45 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Exactly✨
12/3/19, 15:45 - +234 706 900 2818: John, did you notice this MDA - National Institute for Arabic and Islamic studies, i think....
the capital allocation is more than that of major universities combined
12/3/19, 15:45 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I'll confirm this now
12/3/19, 15:45 - Richie: Me
12/3/19, 15:46 - Richie: https://www.linkedin.com/in/richie-uchenna-akparuorji-85180111b
12/3/19, 15:46 - AcidiQ: I have zero experience with Power Bi but this just motivated me. Friday will be very interesting and insightful.
12/3/19, 15:46 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I also learnt that there is a federal government secondary school in all 36 states plus the FcT
12/3/19, 15:46 - Richie: Mine alma mater is 1st
12/3/19, 15:46 - AcidiQ: Yea, this is true. I attended one.
12/3/19, 15:47 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 🙌🏽🙌🏽
12/3/19, 15:47 - Opeyemi Tosin: O...
Cool 😁
12/3/19, 15:47 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Nice. There's so much information about Nigeria contained in the budget
12/3/19, 15:48 - Opeyemi Tosin: All the 10 top universities are old schools 🤣
12/3/19, 15:48 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I didn't know this before 😅
12/3/19, 15:48 - Richie: House am currently at my grandfather burial.. Its not easy but any free time i have will try my best... Honestly i haven't been this stressed
12/3/19, 15:49 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: As expected 😅
12/3/19, 15:49 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Sorry about this. It's already
12/3/19, 15:49 - Opeyemi Tosin: Including Boko haram affected state....


Hmmmm 🤔
Can you get the list of all the states affected by insurgencies and see if that boost the budget allocated to them.
12/3/19, 15:50 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I was thinking this same thing yesterday
12/3/19, 15:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: So sorry about that Bro.
12/3/19, 15:50 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Even some of the FGC's have been attacked by Boko Haram
12/3/19, 15:51 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: For example, FGC buni-yadi in Yobe.. 59 boys were killed
12/3/19, 15:51 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: It woiy be interesting to have this as a visual
12/3/19, 15:51 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Would*
12/3/19, 15:52 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I'll have a look at this
12/3/19, 15:52 - Opeyemi Tosin: Na wa oo...
12/3/19, 15:52 - Richie: Thanks
12/3/19, 15:53 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Sorry to hear this. I hope you get better and get back soon.
12/3/19, 15:53 - Richie: I did something like this in the past
12/3/19, 15:54 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes pls...
You can use powerbi custom visual - infographic I think.... 🤔
12/3/19, 15:54 - Richie: @2348062991199 yes i will.. Thanks
12/3/19, 15:54 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Interesting. I'll check it out
12/3/19, 15:54 - AcidiQ: All the best bro. Hope everything goes well
12/3/19, 15:55 - Opeyemi Tosin: Can we have 👀 a look at the bottom 10
12/3/19, 15:55 - AcidiQ: This info was not in the budget right? I'm guessing you did extra research. That's really commendable. Kudos
12/3/19, 15:55 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Have a link I can see this?
12/3/19, 15:55 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Yes, thanks bro
12/3/19, 15:56 - Richie: I extracted it from various websites like united Nation too bad its in Lagos but let me make some calls
12/3/19, 16:00 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I'm seeing the capital allocation of this as 564 million. 

Both University of Maiduguri and Abuja have proposed capital allocations more than this at 1.3bn and 1.2bn respectively. Besides these two, it's capital allocation is higher than all other institutions
12/3/19, 16:00 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Ok, I'll appreciate. But don't stress too much about it
12/3/19, 16:01 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: @2347069002818
12/3/19, 16:01 - Opeyemi Tosin: How many schools in total?
12/3/19, 16:02 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: You mean Universities or secondary schools?
12/3/19, 16:02 - Opeyemi Tosin: *Universities
12/3/19, 16:04 - +234 706 900 2818: With the exception of universities of maiduguri, and abuja, 
if you check capital allocations for universities of benin, jos, ibadan, ilorin, lagos, and calabar combined, its not up to 564m
12/3/19, 16:04 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/3/19, 16:06 - +234 706 900 2818: this is the total allocation, i think. can you filter for capital projects, perhaps you find an anomaly
12/3/19, 16:06 - Opeyemi Tosin: They are all new schools 😁
12/3/19, 16:08 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: This is true
12/3/19, 16:15 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Interesting
12/3/19, 16:15 - Richie: Bro i jx sent my LinkedIn profile
12/3/19, 16:18 - +234 706 900 2818: and one institute on arabic stuff is getting 564m as capital allocation...is that not abnormal?
12/3/19, 16:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/3/19, 16:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: @2347069002818
12/3/19, 16:26 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 20 billion.. I wonder how it's split between Universities
12/3/19, 16:27 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Thank you!
12/3/19, 16:36 - +234 706 900 2818: wawu...20 billion
12/3/19, 17:12 - +234 809 440 5059: Hey @dadapeter on LinkedIn

12/3/19, 21:29 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Looking forward to this. See you there! 😁
12/4/19, 11:20 - +234 809 440 5059: so all columns are compiled?
12/4/19, 11:29 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 11:33 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Has anyone created the data model or connected to the data?
12/4/19, 11:33 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 11:33 - +234 809 837 4664: I'm on it

Just a problem with the sub-MDAs
12/4/19, 11:36 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Can you check the column distribution for the MDA column? 

Because many column headers were included in the combine operation, you have to remove them
12/4/19, 11:46 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 12:12 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: No.

First delete the Changed Type transformation.

Check the list of items under Code or MDA Code column.
12/4/19, 12:13 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: @2348173559817 can you help with this?
12/4/19, 12:14 - +234 809 837 4664: Yes he is 💯💯

We are talking on it
12/4/19, 12:14 - +234 809 837 4664: Let me do this now
12/4/19, 12:16 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 12:17 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 12:19 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I haven't actually tried Excel. I'll check when I'm by a PC and get back to you
12/4/19, 12:21 - +234 809 837 4664: Alright💯

Thank you
12/4/19, 12:22 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I know what's wrong now.

There's no need for the other columns on personnel, total allocation, overheads etc. 

Just select the Code, MDA Code and MDA and remove other columns.

The figures are already captured in Expenditure Items table
12/4/19, 12:30 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/4/19, 12:35 - +234 909 964 9854: Please can I get the video or blog post
12/4/19, 12:35 - +234 809 837 4664: I think i'm good now
12/4/19, 12:36 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Okay good. You can always add an index when needed
12/4/19, 12:37 - +234 809 837 4664: I had to uncheck the enable load for summary by sub-MDAs, and rename the 'errors in summary by sub-MDA' to "summary by sub-MDA" since it contained added index and I check 'enable load'

Closed and applied, and it worked fine
12/4/19, 12:37 - +234 809 837 4664: Yes

Thank you very much
12/4/19, 12:39 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Your Summary by sub-MDAs should also connect directly to the Expenditure Items. A many-to-many relationship, I think
12/4/19, 12:40 - +234 809 837 4664: Yes

Many to many


The blog post is really helpful too

I was following it one by one to make sure it's all the same

12/4/19, 19:39 - Opeyemi Tosin: Quick one Bro, should we filter out all the capital projects with status = null
12/4/19, 19:40 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: No null is still valid.
12/4/19, 19:42 - Opeyemi Tosin: Okay Bro...But it's safe to filter out code = 0

12/4/19, 21:04 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Okay that's great. The first part involving the extraction and data engineering are done. You will find relevant links to those tutorials in the group description. You can also use it to learn some automation in Power BI.

For data modelling, visualisation and story telling, the last article in the description will get you going.
12/4/19, 21:05 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: http://bit.ly/FGNOpenData

Some compelling visuals have been created with more in development. We want to have your own visual story 😊

12/4/19, 21:26 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Firstly, what do you want to talk about?

There's a wealth of data.

John has done something on the Ministry of Education

I'm flipping through Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the moment. Still undecided although I've done some analysis on newspaper costs and energy costs
12/4/19, 21:26 - Opeyemi Tosin: You need choice of visualisation tutorial🤣
12/4/19, 21:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: We tried getting a host for this workshop but the organiser flipped on us last minute.
12/4/19, 21:29 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: We're hoping people will be inspired by the ones that will be showcased on Friday.

So if you can have some interesting visuals ready for Friday, we'd be happy to showcase your work and have you tell the audience your story.
12/4/19, 21:30 - Opeyemi Tosin: awwwn......... that's not cool....Meanwhile I'm interest in anything security (Police Affair, Defence etc)
12/4/19, 21:31 - Opeyemi Tosin: Ehen ehen.... but people like me won't be on ground oooo.... hope e no matter.
12/4/19, 21:32 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 😥 Would have loved to have you talk about your short journey
12/4/19, 21:33 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: You can still send us visuals anyway. You're already a contributor
12/4/19, 21:34 - Opeyemi Tosin: With Tableau story module, I think the data can speak for herself 😁
12/4/19, 21:35 - Opeyemi Tosin: Okay Boss ... Thanks
12/4/19, 21:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: For real?
12/4/19, 21:36 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Any accountant or finance professional in the house? Anyone familiar with Benford's law?

12/4/19, 22:08 - Opeyemi Tosin: Why do we always remove "Changed Type"?
12/4/19, 22:10 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It automatically formats all columns. Most times, you may need to apply transformations to the columns before changing the type
12/4/19, 22:15 - Opeyemi Tosin: O o o .... Lemme add that to the list of magic have learnt from you

12/5/19, 15:29 - +234 806 489 8353: have to move to the summary of the subMDAs
12/5/19, 15:30 - Opeyemi Tosin: Are you using powerbi or you just click on the link
12/5/19, 15:31 - Opeyemi Tosin: Anyways, change =ods to =xlsx

Hopefully this should fix it.
12/5/19, 15:33 - +234 806 489 8353: PowerBI needs to open the link first to enable change the fille format
12/5/19, 15:33 - +234 806 489 8353: NO, it doesnt.....the link cant be found

12/5/19, 15:39 - +234 806 489 8353: Thanks Ope for trying to help💪🏻
12/5/19, 15:39 - Opeyemi Tosin: Quick one @2348062991199, to visualise a particular MDA, we can duplicate the cleaned summary by MDAs and subMDAs right and put the filter to the MDA of interest. Or should we just load all the cleaned datasets and use the page/report filter.
12/5/19, 15:39 - Opeyemi Tosin: You are welcome 🤗
12/5/19, 16:09 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: To visualise a particular MDA, you can use filters.

Or you write some measures in DAX to calculate certain operations you want to extract for a particular MDA
12/5/19, 16:10 - Opeyemi Tosin: Well noted 😊

12/5/19, 17:26 - Opeyemi Tosin: But column chart is summarising the expense amount for me despite the fact that I have enabled "do not summarise"....
12/5/19, 17:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Hmm I don't understand. What chart?
12/5/19, 17:30 - Opeyemi Tosin: Sorry bar chart 📊 😁
It's a type of column charts tho
12/5/19, 17:34 - Opeyemi Tosin: I will to visualise the Expense Amount per Sub MDAs under Ministry of Defense. So I selected a bar chart (label =SubMDAs, value = Expense Amount).

12/5/19, 18:21 - +234 809 837 4664: I think I have a problem with this too

Filtering an MDA is not a problem

But filtering the Sub-MDAs to make sure all the filtered sub-MDAs align with the filtered MDA is the problem with me
12/5/19, 18:22 - +234 809 837 4664: How about for the Sub-MDAs?

How can u go about it with the DAX of a something
12/5/19, 18:22 - +234 809 837 4664: My love for visuals😭💓💓

But really, it's very challenging😭😭
12/5/19, 18:26 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes but Y is it summarising the expense amount nah
12/5/19, 18:26 - +234 809 837 4664: Kaii

Currently in transit. I'll send it once I get home to use the laptop
12/5/19, 18:32 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I agree but it's very exciting o. Been doing some workarounds which I'll share tomorrow.
12/5/19, 18:33 - +234 809 837 4664: I'm longing for it already💯💓
12/5/19, 18:33 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: this view here is summing the expense amount by the project name

You can add a MDA filter to group it
12/5/19, 18:37 - +234 809 837 4664: Quick one

Please what is the difference between the function of a slicer and the filter
12/5/19, 18:40 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Slicer-vs-Filters-Section/td-p/331698

This article should help
12/5/19, 18:42 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: A slicer is a way to visualise and apply a filter to a chart

Filters generally allow you to group data, show top x visuals, and categorise data for a visual or for an entire report.
12/5/19, 18:43 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: A slicer in Power BI is a visual. You drop categorical data which helps you filter your data.

A filter is not a visual.
12/5/19, 18:47 - +234 809 837 4664: God bless u

Understood 💯

Thank you
12/5/19, 18:57 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: ✌🏼
12/5/19, 18:58 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348062991199 after sorting the tabular visual, I discovered that the sum of expense amount in the bar chart did not have any effect of the expense amount.......
12/5/19, 19:06 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: My brain is beginning to lock up o 😅
12/5/19, 19:07 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Can I see your data model bro?
12/5/19, 19:20 - Opeyemi Tosin: ahhhhh... no vex baba.. so sorry for stressing you with my wahala... just that this thing is fun when you are rest assured that you are on the right track.

12/5/19, 19:26 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I like your information design skills. Nice
12/5/19, 19:26 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Both visuals are depicting the same information though.
12/5/19, 19:27 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Can you change the bar on the right and do some analysis on the expenditure items of the MOD?
12/5/19, 19:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Wait, am I seeing - Establishment of defence section in the embassy of Nigeria in Saudi Arabia for ~1.5bn? Cheii
12/5/19, 19:30 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes pls... Have not even started visualising ooo, I'm still scratching the surface 😁

12/5/19, 19:37 - +234 809 837 4664: This is great💪💪

I'm still learning😭😭

Please how did u come about the Naira sign as well as the coma signs in the figures
12/5/19, 19:38 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: This looks alright

12/5/19, 19:40 - +234 809 837 4664: I tried this before but it said it couldn't connect cos it's ambiguous or something

But I didn't delete the 1 to many relationship between MDA and Sub-MDA

I'll try it now
12/5/19, 19:41 - +234 809 837 4664: If I do it, will it distort my previous shaku shaku visuals?😭😭

12/5/19, 19:42 - +234 809 837 4664: Tooo much😂

Thank you💯
12/5/19, 19:45 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Interesting. This is the entire budget! And you can filter for any MDA to get more information.

Azeez I hope you're gearing up for how you'll describe your visual
12/5/19, 19:46 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I need about 3 visuals from 3 people that would like to present and discuss tomorrow
12/5/19, 19:49 - Opeyemi Tosin: 🤔 tomorrow is upon us, mehn that's fast
12/5/19, 21:36 - +234 808 394 6280: It seems the Google link has been retracted.

12/5/19, 22:23 - +234 809 837 4664: Yes, I believe so

I am trying to work on Ministry of science now

The relationship u talked about worked

SoI am trying to come up with some visuals for it
12/5/19, 22:23 - +234 809 837 4664: Seriously🙂🙂
12/5/19, 22:23 - +234 809 837 4664: 😂😂😂

12/5/19, 22:30 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Can anyone else confirm this?
12/5/19, 22:30 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It's working here
12/5/19, 22:32 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: To be brutally honest, the modelling still has to be refined to get the best performance
12/5/19, 23:02 - +234 809 837 4664: Yes

I am beginning to understand it very well

So once I need something for the visual and it is not giving me, I go to the model to change relationships
12/6/19, 00:04 - +234 806 489 8353: BREAKING: Senate passes 2020 appropriations bill of N10.59 trillion into law.
12/6/19, 00:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It increased by a few billions.
12/6/19, 00:30 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Sage level Azeez.
12/6/19, 00:30 - +234 809 837 4664: Yeah

It didn't affect expenditure items sha

12/6/19, 00:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I've been staring at this for a while now Azeez. I think this is awesome!! Glad you've gotten a hang of this.
12/6/19, 00:38 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Can you add color conditional formatting on the total allocation column to show darker green for higher expenses?
12/6/19, 00:42 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It's good to see a huge chunk of money going into capital for the ministry of Science and Tech. But the full description of the project is not showing. Can you have a duplicate where you swap the charts and content with each other - Expense Amount becomes a table and MDA becomes the bar chart?
12/6/19, 00:43 - +234 809 837 4664: Yo👏😂

Thank you💪💪

Feels good to come up with something of this. Been confused since the beginning of the day on how to create glo OGASIM charts like you all do🙌🙌
12/6/19, 00:43 - +234 809 837 4664: I grab this

Will do that now
12/6/19, 00:45 - +234 809 837 4664: Let me try this too

I'll get back
12/6/19, 00:48 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 💪🏽💪🏽
12/6/19, 01:19 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 01:26 - +234 809 837 4664: Doing this

The full description of the Sub-MDAs too is not showing while that of the capital project is now showing
12/6/19, 01:29 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Seems like you've used a bar chart breakdown with the MDAs. Is it possible to use only background colour to show the variation in allocation amount?
12/6/19, 01:29 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: That's sad
12/6/19, 01:31 - +234 809 837 4664: Yes

But it is only giving me variation for the largest
12/6/19, 01:31 - +234 809 837 4664: The rest of the others still have the same colours
12/6/19, 01:32 - +234 809 837 4664: Actually. If the cusor touches any one of the bars, the full project name comes out
12/6/19, 01:33 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 01:41 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: That's to show you that there's a huge difference between the first project and the average of the next few projects
12/6/19, 01:41 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yeah. I know but imagine when you share that as a static image?
12/6/19, 01:45 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It won't fully convey the info that it should. It's tough designing dashboards that satisfy both static and dynamic reports
12/6/19, 01:53 - +234 809 837 4664: This message was deleted
12/6/19, 01:56 - +234 809 837 4664: Yesss

That's true

The MDA with the largest share has double the amount the MDA with the second largest share

Then the gap becomes thinner as u move down
12/6/19, 01:57 - +234 809 837 4664: Oooo true

The report view seems to be small when working with things like this
12/6/19, 01:57 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I feel your pain bro
12/6/19, 06:46 - +234 813 687 5225: Good morning all. 

Trust we had an awesome night rest.
12/6/19, 06:47 - +234 813 687 5225: Please can someone help with the description to Rise network from Iyana Ipaja axis 

Thanks
12/6/19, 06:55 - Opeyemi Tosin: You are indeed a big boy @2348098374664

Abegi what type of visual do you use for the Total Allocation, Total Capital, etc... I guess that's Card right?
12/6/19, 06:55 - Opeyemi Tosin: Good morning all
12/6/19, 07:15 - +234 806 351 4863: Please can someone resend the address for me??

12/6/19, 08:21 - +234 706 811 1035: Ok
12/6/19, 08:39 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348062991199 ```so sorry I couldn't get back to you regarding the visualisation I was working on. I'm on official assignment here and it has not been smooth for me to multitask.

Have made some progress tho but I can't guarantee if it will be ready before the workshop. Please bear with me.
Many thanks for your understanding ```
12/6/19, 09:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 😁💪🏽 Strong man. I can understand perfectly. I'm honoured you dedicated time towards this project

12/6/19, 10:30 - +234 909 964 9854: I can see lots of skills here and i am really happy , it means we as Nigerians posses powerful minds to do this , I am still learning from u guys even if I use a lot of power BI at work . I wish I could come today but time is really against me that’s why I prefer weekend . But Can I get a video recording 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
12/6/19, 10:32 - +234 909 964 9854: Secondly i believe we could use this skills to push up Nigerian businesses with a touch of consultancy, especially SME . 
It’s just a wild thought, please holla if there is need to discuss this further 😊
12/6/19, 10:35 - +234 909 964 9854: Same here
12/6/19, 10:36 - Opeyemi Tosin: You use powerbi at work 🤔 and you are still learning from us... How na?
12/6/19, 10:36 - +234 909 964 9854: Lol
12/6/19, 10:38 - +234 909 964 9854: No man is an island or knows it all 😊

12/6/19, 11:27 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: We're working on a fix for this
12/6/19, 11:27 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: It's proving difficult to accomplish, but I'll keep you guys postes
12/6/19, 11:28 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>

12/8/19, 18:03 - Opeyemi Tosin: This will be nice Bro...
Anticipate 🕺🏿
12/8/19, 18:06 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Worksheet?  You mean the visual?
12/8/19, 18:13 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes Bro
12/8/19, 18:13 - Opeyemi Tosin: We can idea share our worksheet or send a screenshot
12/8/19, 18:17 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yep yep. What are you working on?
12/8/19, 18:19 - Opeyemi Tosin: Ministry of Defense
12/8/19, 18:33 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Okay, please do send an image
12/8/19, 18:33 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Later I will explain exactly how the PBIX file (Power BI) should be formatted.
12/8/19, 18:34 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Btw, did anyone try any other BI tool? Excel? Qlik? Tableau? (Damn, I had a challenging moment with Tableau yesterday)
12/8/19, 18:38 - Opeyemi Tosin: I was thinking of Tableau but Tableau wahala too much fa
12/8/19, 18:41 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Baba are you from Ilorin?
12/8/19, 18:43 - Opeyemi Tosin: 🤣🤣🤣

12/8/19, 18:46 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 😅👌🏽
12/8/19, 18:47 - Opeyemi Tosin: I think we should just stick with PowerBI, those guys are adding amazing features per time to make the application more flexible, sophisticated and easy to use.

12/8/19, 18:49 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I agree!!
12/8/19, 18:50 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 18:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: Tableau is cool with historical data, especially when you want to play your visualisation to see trends per year but when it comes to data cleaning l, I think they need to do more.
12/8/19, 18:51 - Opeyemi Tosin: Okay Bro.
12/8/19, 18:54 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Oh well, I'm glad we're on the bright side
12/8/19, 18:58 - Opeyemi Tosin: Hahahaha.. 😁

I'm learning Tableau too ooooo
12/8/19, 18:59 - +234 806 079 8098: Noted. Will do a post before this week runs out. Great job, Boss @2348062991199
12/8/19, 19:01 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 🙄🙄 this life sha
12/8/19, 19:01 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Thank you my brother
12/8/19, 19:08 - Opeyemi Tosin: 😁
12/8/19, 19:09 - Opeyemi Tosin: Inside life
12/8/19, 19:23 - +234 806 222 9997: Both Tableau and Power BI have their strengths.
I have done projects with the two.
Truly power query is fantastic, but we shouldn't forget that Excel as the grandparent has evolved over the years. Excel is more than 30 years old.
When I see power query generating codes for steps done, I reminisce on VBA and macros because that's the way the latter too generates codes when put to record actions.

Tableau is just 10 years plus, and it's very fantastic too. And again there are many packages to Tableau. When you are talking of data cleaning/preprocessing, Tableau Prep as a variant of the software, will do more for you than Tableau online or Desktop in data preparation, that's however unlike Power BI that everything is bundled into one software. And Tableau has way much more types of charts you can play with than Power BI. It will surprise you to know how many various charts you can make out of either column or bar charts alone. Power BI doesn't have that luxury, and when you need to supplement, you would have to be searching in the store.

Summary, both are good, have strengths and weaknesses.
12/8/19, 19:28 - Opeyemi Tosin: Well said Bro...
But which one do you prefer?
12/8/19, 19:35 - +234 806 222 9997: I don Lagoon and Atlantic o, I have settle with Power BI for many reasons.
Even power BI desktop is a tip of the iceberg when seen from the perspective of power BI service. I won't forget to add the AI/machine learning/text analytics already tools in power bi and all that.
Power BI 👊👊👊
12/8/19, 19:36 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 💪🏽😝
12/8/19, 19:37 - +234 806 222 9997: I don go Lagoon and Atlantic... I meant
12/8/19, 19:37 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Considering Power BI is only 4 years old and they've come this far, I'd bank on Microsoft on the future of BI...at least for now.
12/8/19, 19:38 - Opeyemi Tosin: The AI features mad gan... 😁
12/8/19, 19:38 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Plus Power Automate and Power Apps give a whole new dimension to BI and automation.
12/8/19, 19:41 - Opeyemi Tosin: Microsoft ain't smiling at all, I won't even be surprised if I find out that they have made several mores to purchase Tableau.
12/8/19, 19:42 - Opeyemi Tosin: *moves
12/8/19, 19:42 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Salesforce bought Tableau earlier this year. Unless Satya wants to chew more than he can bite 😅
12/8/19, 19:43 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Or is it 'bite more than he can chew'?🤔
12/8/19, 19:44 - Opeyemi Tosin: All join ooooo 🤣
Bite na bite.
12/8/19, 19:47 - +234 806 222 9997: It is hard for me to imagine what power BI would have become in the next couple of years...I don't want to imagine it.
That monthly updates of feature is crazy. I don't know who is thinking for them and telling them what to add or improve.
We need to learn so.much from these people in this part of the world. People creating mad invention out of nothing, with worth more than countries GDP.
I saw a couple of days ago that worth of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and 2 other companies' is.much more than nearly all the African countries GDP.

Those are companies that are built on purely power of imagination and creativity.
Truly the best and greatest wealth come from the invisible realm, the mind to be specific.
12/8/19, 19:48 - Opeyemi Tosin: 🤔
12/8/19, 19:53 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Truly, we have so much to learn and imbibe. Continuous innovation and development is a must!
12/8/19, 20:23 - Opeyemi Tosin: Nice Bro... Choose of visual is on point.
12/8/19, 20:35 - +234 813 687 5225: <Media omitted>
12/8/19, 21:00 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Very clear insights Dave 😁
12/8/19, 21:01 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: What is the slider at the top filtering?
12/8/19, 21:10 - +234 813 687 5225: It's filtering the range of total allocations that's been allotted to each of the visuals to help drill down each of the Sunday's
12/8/19, 21:12 - +234 809 837 4664: Welldone boss💯💯
12/8/19, 21:12 - +234 809 837 4664: 💓💥
12/8/19, 21:14 - +234 809 837 4664: I've been trying to use excel but it has not been connecting

Has anybody successfully connected to the data with excel?
12/8/19, 21:20 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Hmm curious to know how that looks
12/8/19, 21:21 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Same here to no avail. Also tried Tableau, but going to download some web connector was just looong
12/8/19, 21:24 - +234 809 837 4664: Oo ok

I would have loved to use excel too here
12/9/19, 04:20 - +234 806 489 8353: <Media omitted>
12/9/19, 04:21 - Opeyemi Tosin: This your color choice lasan
12/9/19, 04:22 - +234 806 489 8353: I love my country na
12/9/19, 04:23 - Opeyemi Tosin: You didn't put people suffering with color blindness into consideration. btw, that's not Nigeria color sire
12/9/19, 04:23 - Opeyemi Tosin: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/what-to-consider-when-choosing-colors-for-data-visualization/
12/9/19, 04:25 - Opeyemi Tosin: This article should help Bro, you can also find more article online on the best practice for choosing the right color for data visualisation.
12/9/19, 04:25 - +234 806 489 8353: I thought that was a green colour,
12/9/19, 04:25 - +234 806 489 8353: Okay, thanks .

I will check it out now
12/9/19, 04:27 - Opeyemi Tosin: Not Nigerian Green... but you've done a green job Bro.
12/9/19, 04:30 - +234 806 489 8353: A green job.lol.
Thanks
12/9/19, 09:42 - +234 813 697 8068: 'Nigeria Electricity Liability Management'.
I never knew there was an agency like that under the Ministry  of Power. What do they do actually?
12/9/19, 09:42 - +234 813 697 8068: Cool, thank you Tobi
12/9/19, 09:43 - +234 813 697 8068: Okay noted
12/9/19, 09:44 - +234 813 687 5225: Is there anybody in power sector here or studies vertical electronics engineering?
12/9/19, 10:00 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348060798098 Electrical and Electronics Engineering
12/9/19, 10:03 - +234 806 079 8098: Which one is vertical electronics engineering...
12/9/19, 10:06 - +234 806 079 8098: Please shed more light and let's see what we can exchange ideas and / or work together.

Awaiting your response
12/9/19, 10:07 - +234 806 079 8098: *how we can exchange ideas

Kudos guys!
12/9/19, 12:47 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Nice✨✨. Please engage with the post if you have not
12/9/19, 12:47 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Share you experience working on the project and tag us
12/9/19, 12:47 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Your*
12/9/19, 12:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: We await your comment Bro... 😁
12/9/19, 12:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: Abi ooooo 😁
12/9/19, 12:57 - AcidiQ: I'm still expecting the pictures Boss.
12/9/19, 13:00 - +234 806 222 9997: I liked since yesterday, I should add comment
12/9/19, 13:36 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: this would be great

12/9/19, 14:32 - +234 706 900 2818: this is cool
12/9/19, 14:33 - +234 806 489 8353: With the launch of the Open Treasury Portal today by President @MBuhari, all MDAs are to publish the following: daily reports of payments from N5m; monthly budget performance; quarterly financial statements; and annual financial statements prepared in compliance with IPSAS.
12/9/19, 14:34 - +234 706 900 2818: i have been thinking about the title of some of our visuals, where we used "by".
like sales by category, expenditure by this, capital projects by that.
i understand the analyst might understand this, but in terms of storytelling with data, which is the endpoint of everything...does it really appeal to our audience
12/9/19, 15:10 - Opeyemi Tosin: O nice... 😁
12/9/19, 15:11 - Opeyemi Tosin: Hmmmm 🤔
12/9/19, 15:12 - +234 806 489 8353: All the reports are to be published within stipulated deadlines on this portal: opentreasury.gov.ng
12/9/19, 15:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: If you really want to tell a story, you should look for more interesting headings. E.g 

What projects will the Ministry of Power embark on in 2020?

How much will the Presidency spend on newspapers?

Which MDA in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs receives the highest capital allocation? 

It can be wordy, but it sends the message across
12/9/19, 15:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Thank you for this 🙌🏽🙌🏽
12/9/19, 15:39 - +234 806 489 8353: Amazing, something to arouse the audience interest.
12/9/19, 15:39 - +234 806 489 8353: Anytime boss .
12/9/19, 15:40 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: This is really cool.

A few pointers:
- Total Capital by MDA (pie chart) doesn't show any MDA as label

- the KPIs at the top can be confusing in the way they are arranged. People read from left to right, and tend to add figures with that logic. In this case, may I suggest putting Total Personnel, total Overhead, total Capital then Total Allocation. 

Don't forget Recurrent = personnel + overheads
12/9/19, 15:41 - +234 813 687 5225: Noted. I will work on that
12/9/19, 15:43 - Opeyemi Tosin: Lemme add this to my starred message. ✍🏿
12/9/19, 18:51 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348062991199 & @2348173559817

Hope we can analyse more than one MDAs...?
12/9/19, 18:58 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: That shouldn't be a problem
12/9/19, 18:59 - Opeyemi Tosin: Aiit..
12/9/19, 19:23 - +234 806 079 8098: @2348173559817 pls help this number to the group +234 703 739 2006

12/9/19, 21:56 - +234 806 489 8353: @2348062991199 , a quick one pls.
12/9/19, 21:58 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yeah
12/9/19, 22:00 - +234 806 489 8353: i observed that we have been analysing with a total allocation of 9trillion + and it just cross my mind that the total budget should be 10trillion +
12/9/19, 22:00 - +234 806 489 8353: can u shed more light on this pls?
12/9/19, 22:06 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Awesome! Thanks for asking.

There are some items which are not included in the national budget breakdown. If you look at the appropriation bill on the budget office website, however, you will see a brief total breakdown summing up to 10 trillion+

This is one of the reasons why I was hoping a finance professional was here who could help us out.
12/9/19, 22:07 - Opeyemi Tosin: Maybe we should outsource for financial gurus.
12/9/19, 22:09 - +234 806 489 8353: Okay, thanks a lot @2348062991199, you are amazing .
12/9/19, 22:11 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Sure thing. You too bro 😁
12/9/19, 22:33 - +234 806 489 8353: 🙇🙇🙇
12/10/19, 11:48 - +234 806 351 4863: Good morning everyone
12/10/19, 11:49 - +234 806 351 4863: Please I need you guys assistance

Does anyone know how I can get sample questions of IKM test for data analytics role?

Thanks
12/10/19, 15:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Never heard of IKM test, sorry
12/10/19, 21:28 - +234 806 489 8353: <Media omitted>
12/10/19, 21:31 - AcidiQ: Total budget allocation is not 9 trillion but about 10.59 trillion. We'll need to resolve this. 

Nice visualization. Try adjusting your color combinations.
12/10/19, 21:34 - +234 806 489 8353: Yea, I thought as much, the background colour is dull.

I just realised that after publishing.
12/10/19, 21:35 - Opeyemi Tosin: This writeup will help you. 
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/what-to-consider-when-choosing-colors-for-data-visualization/
12/10/19, 21:36 - Opeyemi Tosin: Also you can't use donut chart for all MDAs... It's difficult to understand the point you are driving out.
12/10/19, 21:37 - +234 806 489 8353: Thanks for sharing Tosin.
12/10/19, 21:38 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348064898353 👆🏿
12/10/19, 21:39 - +234 806 489 8353: I think it works well like a pie chart also.
12/10/19, 21:39 - +234 806 489 8353: 👏👏👏
12/10/19, 21:40 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes but for best practice ehn... U use donut & pie chart for max. of 3-4 variables.
12/10/19, 21:46 - +234 806 489 8353: You are right, the next chart shows the top 10 MDAs by allocation, follow by top 10 capital project .
The idea of the design was to be strategic, and analytical just like you have pointed out .

The donut charts shows all the mdas, while the bar charts shows the top 10 mdas.
12/11/19, 10:40 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Morning guys, 

I will share a template today on how the visuals will be collated and displayed on our website, so we can officially close this project.

We'll be uploading the PBIX files online, attributed to the creators who'll be sharing a few takeaways from their visuals
12/11/19, 11:48 - Opeyemi Tosin: Awesome 🤗
12/11/19, 12:20 - +234 806 222 9997: <Media omitted>
12/11/19, 12:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: All thanks to you all o 🙇🏽‍♂
12/11/19, 13:08 - +234 703 461 5552 joined using this group's invite link
12/11/19, 20:53 - +234 809 837 4664: Still waiting on this.

Again, all the visuals will be on one report abi? (One will just have different pages)

Yeah?
12/11/19, 20:55 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: One sec, been really busy
12/11/19, 21:11 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/11/19, 21:18 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Very straightforward actually.

We need about 10 stellar visuals with powerful insights to go along.

To allow more contributors, we'll be limiting this to *1 visual per report author.*

So guys, let's extract some useful insights from this budget that will be showcased to the world. And trust me, people are watching!!! 😁

I would ask that when you have your visuals ready, you forward the PBIX file directly to me - servus@resagratia.com.

We can discuss your visual on this forum before you send it in. I'll create another sheet on the contributors worksheet now. This will serve as the collaboration sheet for the visuals.

Let me know what y'all think 🙏🏼
12/11/19, 21:19 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Oh, I want this to go out Monday or Tuesday next week.
12/11/19, 21:26 - AcidiQ: This is great.
12/11/19, 21:26 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EsaZP2_6UGbpa1XZ4vkl0Oal9Wm-tuQYVHKNFjFnnKE/edit#gid=2088302880

Collaboration sheet.

If you'll be submitting a visual, just go in here and include your name and the ministry/visual you're working on. This will give others a reference as to what they could work on.
12/11/19, 21:27 - AcidiQ: I think it's a great idea. Is it one visual or one report?
12/11/19, 21:27 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Okay I mentioned *1 visual per report author* earlier. I'm thinking we can have *up to 2 reports* within the same PBIX file.
12/11/19, 21:28 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: So, 1 PBI file, up to 2 reports (2 pages)
12/11/19, 21:32 - AcidiQ: Okay, great. Thank you Boss.
12/11/19, 21:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Cheers bro
12/11/19, 21:36 - Opeyemi Tosin: Good one @2348062991199 , thanks for the update. The template is on point to the best of my knowledge and I think the timing too is cool. Atleast we have all the weekend to sit down with the data and get more revelations from it. I will try repackage my initial visual for ministry of power and also add Federal Ministry of Health to it. Thanks again and again my Oga.
12/11/19, 21:55 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Niice. Well done. Let me know when you're working on the Ministry of Health :)
12/11/19, 21:56 - +234 813 697 8068: I dont fully understand this, do you mean each person should select just one ministry and create a visual with it?
12/11/19, 21:58 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Hmm not exactly one ministry, although that would make things simpler. 

For the PBI file that you will submit, it shouldn't have more than 2 pages i.e. 2 reports
12/11/19, 21:59 - Opeyemi Tosin: I will start looking into it on Friday. I noticed that Obinna too is also interested in the Federal Ministry of Health. My plan is to ask reasonable questions about the budget and visualise it with an eye catching visuals. I hope powerbi won't gimme tough time 😃
12/11/19, 21:59 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I hope so too o. So we have more than 1 author working on the Ministry of Health hmm
12/11/19, 22:02 - Opeyemi Tosin: I remember someone did some visualisation on how much the goverment intend to spend on newspapper and event. I don't think this have to do with any MDA na... so it won't be a bad idea to have something like this.
12/11/19, 22:06 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It's a great idea. You can mix and match!
12/11/19, 22:07 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: But please, have a story to make people curious, with a clear direction
12/11/19, 22:08 - +234 813 697 8068: Oh okay
12/11/19, 22:08 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: For the engineers in the house, don't worry, another project underway!!
12/11/19, 22:19 - +234 813 697 8068: Is it okay for two authors to work on the same ministry?
12/11/19, 22:20 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: First instinct is no. However, if the authors have different information to portray then sure thing!
12/11/19, 22:21 - +234 813 697 8068: Okay
12/11/19, 23:46 - +234 809 837 4664: Straight forward💯💯

I already have a report for about 6 to 7 visuals

But to do this now, will I have to reconnect to the overall data again online and go back to the stages of cleaning to come about the star schema?

Or will I have to delete all I have done before and just limit to only two pages?
12/11/19, 23:47 - +234 809 837 4664: 💪💪
12/11/19, 23:51 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: You can duplicate your PBI file.

Remove other reports that you don't want to include in your submission.

You can refresh if you want but you don't need to reconnect and redo any transformations.
12/12/19, 00:33 - +234 809 837 4664: I grab this now💯

Thank you
12/12/19, 00:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 💪🏽💪🏽
12/12/19, 19:04 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Hey guys, I trust we're all doing well?
You guys remember the foreign mission dashboard we presented in the workshop? 

We'll, we've put out an article on how to build a similar dasbboard

12/12/19, 19:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I've spent alot of time preparing this 😪. So more than anything, I would really appreciate to see you guys try to recreate it.
12/12/19, 19:06 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: And more importantly, post on your social media platforms and tag Resagratia
12/12/19, 19:09 - +234 806 222 9997: God bless you John.

I fight hard these days to be giving back to the community... 
9 to 5 is a serious matter🤦‍♂

But I am getting there. I have been there before now. Giving back is a must
12/12/19, 19:10 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: First person to recreate this successfully gets a gift from @2348062991199  😁. 

Don't take my word for it tho😅
12/12/19, 19:10 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Amen.

12/12/19, 19:13 - Opeyemi Tosin: Christmas gift abi
12/12/19, 19:13 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Recreate and find out 🌚
12/12/19, 19:15 - Opeyemi Tosin: No wahala, could have get on it right away but I'm in the middle of something now. Hopefully, I should be less busy tomorrow evening. Lemme even check self.
12/12/19, 19:21 - Opeyemi Tosin: Have scanned through😁 It's super cool.
12/12/19, 19:35 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Haha this guy 😅👏🏾
12/12/19, 19:36 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Awesome walkthrough John

Let me ask my PA if my schedules are not tighter than Buhari's
12/12/19, 19:43 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I'm just joking oh 😅
I'm not spending this Saturday solving analytics problems 😌
12/12/19, 19:44 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Just for chills. It's end of year for us.
Conversations on analytics will come up either way 😅
12/12/19, 19:45 - Opeyemi Tosin: should we come along with our laptop?
12/12/19, 19:47 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: No o please
12/12/19, 19:48 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: My only gadget would be a camera
12/12/19, 20:01 - +234 809 837 4664: Shey me too will not go to tarkwa bay like this🤔

If not for anything, but that boat journey from CMS to tarkwa, feeling the ride and seeing eko atlantic and Dangote refinery at a distance🤔🤔
12/12/19, 20:32 - AcidiQ: What time?
12/12/19, 21:12 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Niice. Me too. Dangote refinery is at the other end of town at Epe isn't it?
12/12/19, 21:12 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Around 11 am. Yet to be finalised.
12/12/19, 21:15 - +234 806 489 8353: Amazing one @2348173559817 ,

I will go through and replicate .
12/12/19, 21:43 - +234 809 837 4664: The refinery is at ibeju lekki but I don't know Epe
12/12/19, 22:07 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Ah okay
12/12/19, 22:37 - Richie: Mehn i have missed alot

12/13/19, 18:15 - +234 706 900 2818: 😂
12/13/19, 18:19 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: Yes we have one starting next year. We're working to make it the best around. So stay tuned
12/13/19, 18:21 - +234 706 900 2818: good one...👍
12/13/19, 18:21 - +234 706 900 2818: i'll look forward to it

12/13/19, 19:27 - +234 813 697 8068: Would definitely be there...the session your're handling Tobi are the areas I'm deeply interested in.
12/13/19, 20:38 - Opeyemi Tosin: Who worked on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the data extraction process 🤦‍♂
12/13/19, 20:42 - +234 809 837 4664: Gengen

Na me😭
12/13/19, 20:42 - +234 809 837 4664: What happened to it?
12/13/19, 20:43 - Opeyemi Tosin: Nothing do you baba, have seen where the issue is😄
12/13/19, 20:43 - +234 809 837 4664: Ope oo😂😂
12/13/19, 20:57 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Haha
12/13/19, 20:58 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: You would mostly be listening to the thought leaders giving sharing their ideas - Seplat, Schneider, Ikeja Electric, GIZ etc
12/13/19, 21:01 - Opeyemi Tosin: I wish the event is on Saturday/Sunday 😔
12/13/19, 21:04 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348173559817 we have 117 Nigeria Embassy in total 😒 and you want us to extract them one by one.... No be small thing oooo
12/13/19, 21:04 - Opeyemi Tosin: *Extract the Country Name & GPS
12/13/19, 21:06 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Don't extract them o. The link has been prepared o
12/13/19, 21:07 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: The extraction just showed you the process taken, so that if you want to apply the technique to your own workflows, you know what to do.
12/13/19, 21:08 - Opeyemi Tosin: Ope oooo.... I for fear... I was following the tutorial line by line ni
12/13/19, 21:08 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I will create another tutorial subsequently on how you can automate this process with Google Maps Geocode API using Python. 

But that's especially for when you have thousands of addresses or locations to lookup
12/13/19, 21:10 - Opeyemi Tosin: I anticipate Baba...I'm in love with Python 😍
12/13/19, 21:10 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 😅 Ah please. 

Maybe you can try to generate another visual from the FGN budget and apply location to show another dimension.
12/13/19, 21:12 - Opeyemi Tosin: No wahala....lemme fast forward the tutorial, connect to power BI and replicate the visual. Once I'm done I will try get my hands dirty.
12/13/19, 21:32 - +234 813 697 8068: Oh okay
12/13/19, 22:04 - +234 809 837 4664: I worked on science and technology not foreign affairs

I must have been high on Friday's weed🙇🙇
12/13/19, 22:38 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: 😂😂😂😂
12/14/19, 11:25 - +234 813 697 8068: Please can anyone give a detailed explanation of the column headers: Total Overhead, Total Recurrent, Total Capital.

Total Capital is the budget for projects to be done right? @2348062991199 @2348173559817
12/14/19, 12:42 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yes. Total Capital ideally should tie to the sum of amounts in the projects.
12/14/19, 12:43 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Total overheads + total personnel + total capital = total allocation

While recurrent = total overheads + total personnel
12/14/19, 22:21 - +234 813 697 8068: Okay
12/20/19, 06:47 - Opeyemi Tosin: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 08:41 - Richie: Will send mine today
12/20/19, 09:46 - +234 813 697 8068: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 09:49 - Opeyemi Tosin: Filter the slicer by the ministry you are working on...
12/20/19, 12:23 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: True, for some reason some of the projects were not marked appropriately
12/20/19, 12:24 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: I.e it wasn't specified if it was a new or ongoing project
12/20/19, 12:25 - Analoh RESAGRATIA: So what you're seeing is expected, just filter by the ministry you're working on and hope no project status was omitted
12/20/19, 12:28 - +234 813 697 8068: Alright then
12/20/19, 13:59 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348062991199 Pls check your mail ✉, thanks.
12/20/19, 18:15 - Opeyemi Tosin: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 18:51 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Well received
12/20/19, 18:58 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Apologies guys, I've had a few things on my plate. The best will be to leave this aspect on visuals generation open while we continuously update the platform where they'll be posted.

I've begun working with some people regarding the visuals they submitted. The goal is to let your visual have a clear focus, so you can tell a story around it. Early next week I will begin posting the insights and visuals.

Also, the breakdown of the new budget is out, but the link isn't available. Anyone had any luck with this?
I've been thinking about a before and after comparison. We know the expenditure has increased.
12/20/19, 19:00 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: For anyone that needs to see the format for the visuals submission, it's simply the PBIX file from Power BI. You can also find this in the Docs section of the media files in this group.

Happy evening ☺
12/20/19, 19:01 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Would update you tonight ​@2348110895622 @2349079382247
12/20/19, 19:03 - Opeyemi Tosin: Thanks Bro...

Pls I will send you the updated version on or before 9pm.
12/20/19, 19:04 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Oh okay, cool
12/20/19, 19:14 - AcidiQ: Ok, great.
12/20/19, 21:31 - +234 809 837 4664: <Media omitted>
12/20/19, 21:58 - Opeyemi Tosin: @2348062991199 have sent the modified copy. Gmail is currently working tirelessly to ensure it's sent successfully cos my network is kinda poor o.
12/20/19, 21:58 - Opeyemi Tosin: 🤔
12/20/19, 22:02 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: But we don't have a detailed breakdown yet. The Minister of Finance posted the link on LinkedIn but it's broken and it doesn't work 😪. Thanks for this btw
12/20/19, 22:02 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Alright, will confirm bro
12/20/19, 23:01 - +234 809 837 4664: Ooo

That's true

Guys are complaining on twitter too
12/24/19, 10:48 - Opeyemi Tosin: Good Morning Guys!
12/24/19, 10:48 - Opeyemi Tosin: How's the holiday going?
12/24/19, 10:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: You can now have your hands on the Approved Budget 2020.... check here 👇🏿
12/24/19, 10:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: https://www.budgetoffice.gov.ng/index.php/2020-approved-budget-details?layout=columns&limitstart=0
12/24/19, 10:53 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Interesting! Thank you brother
12/24/19, 10:55 - +234 806 222 9997: 👏👏👏👏
12/24/19, 10:55 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Looks like it was broken down into individual MDAs but the format is a little different now. Hmmm
12/24/19, 10:56 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: <Media omitted>
12/24/19, 10:56 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes 😋
12/24/19, 10:57 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Haha someone's happy. I'm not
12/24/19, 10:59 - Opeyemi Tosin: I'm understanding Bro. So sorry about that
12/24/19, 11:00 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: It's all good
12/27/19, 09:27 - +234 706 900 2818: Good morning folks...
Compliment of the season to you all

I'd like to ask if anyone here can help review my CV as an analyst
12/27/19, 09:50 - Opeyemi Tosin: There is this website I used to restructure my CV and it makes lotta senses. Once my PC is back online, I will share the link with you.
12/27/19, 09:55 - +234 706 900 2818: Okay. Much thanks
12/27/19, 10:05 - +234 816 820 0696: I would like to have it as well. Good morning
12/27/19, 20:16 - Opeyemi Tosin: This website will help you to build your CV from scratch.

All you need do is to put your job title and select the related job description from the suggestion list. 

www.livecareer.com

To download the clean and well structured CV, you will need to pay subscription fee but no too worry,
www.visualcv.com
got you covered.
12/27/19, 20:40 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Please guys, if you use CV tools to build your CV, try to remove the watermark that usually comes with it.

It doesn't look good when your CV has a watermark on it. Cheers 😊
12/27/19, 20:47 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yes ooooo 😁
Sorry I forgot to add that. Also, you don't need to copy and paste the suggested job description, lift those ones that relate to what you are currently doing or have done at one point in time or the other and repackage it.
12/27/19, 20:48 - Opeyemi Tosin: Nitro PDF or other pdf writer app will help you to remove the watermark.
12/27/19, 20:52 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 👏🏾👏🏾
You can also do 30-days trial of Wondershare PDF or Adobe Acrobat PDF
12/27/19, 20:53 - +234 809 440 5059: How do you filter Top 10 or Bottom 10 visuals
12/27/19, 20:54 - +234 809 440 5059: This things dey skip my brain..
12/27/19, 20:55 - Opeyemi Tosin: Go to filter, Advanced filter - Top N. Add the column you want to filter on and enter 10.

I think there is also Bottom N...
12/27/19, 20:56 - +234 706 900 2818: Thanks man
12/27/19, 20:57 - Opeyemi Tosin: You are most highly welcome 🤗
12/27/19, 21:06 - Opeyemi Tosin: Correction...

Click on the filters available under the menu in your visual page, select filter type = Top N

Show items = Top/Bottom and enter 10 in the text field

Specify the By value (first, last, count(distinct) & count).

I think this should help.
12/27/19, 21:16 - +234 809 440 5059: Oshey
12/30/19, 15:11 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Hi house,

Many thanks to you too.
12/30/19, 15:26 - Opeyemi Tosin: This is very important 😁
My people, we've got this. Billions of insights yet to be unveiled and it won't take us 2hrs to come up with something. Just choose an MDA, start playing with their breakdown and before you know it, inspiration will drop. I believe we can do it, oya let get our hands dirty 😁
12/30/19, 18:27 - +234 809 837 4664: I'm here😭🙌

12/30/19, 18:49 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Can't wait bro 😁💪🏽

12/31/19, 13:04 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: And data engineers
12/31/19, 13:09 - Richie: Even data scientist
12/31/19, 13:12 - +234 809 440 5059: Ok, don't run when you are employed to crunch for a ministry
12/31/19, 13:13 - +234 809 440 5059: Or called to do S.A for a CEO
12/31/19, 13:14 - Richie: Bring your best problem and watch why  RESA born
12/31/19, 13:17 - AcidiQ: Facts!
12/31/19, 13:19 - +234 909 964 9854: Loool nice
12/31/19, 13:19 - +234 809 440 5059: Something bothers me
12/31/19, 13:20 - +234 809 440 5059: This team is a great one....
But I am feeling guilt for not participating fully.
My taste for knowledge consumed me...
12/31/19, 13:21 - +234 809 440 5059: I am working on something, and i want the members here to be very honest with this question...
*WHAT ARE YOU GOOD AT DOING?*
12/31/19, 13:25 - +234 809 440 5059: Me?
Technical Stuffs
          &
*Teaching*
Finished learning *postgreSQL* not quit long and I already have a student🤣
12/31/19, 13:25 - +234 909 964 9854: Please What’s postgreSQL about
12/31/19, 13:26 - +234 703 235 3516: And hope you don't mind another student?
12/31/19, 13:27 - +234 809 440 5059: Structured Query Language(SQL) by PostGre
12/31/19, 13:27 - Richie: Descriptive analysis
Predictive analysis
Prescriptive analysis
Diagonistic analysis



Tools python, excel, sql
I am not very good in powerBI yet
12/31/19, 13:28 - +234 809 440 5059: Can you do regression?
12/31/19, 13:28 - +234 809 440 5059: With Python
12/31/19, 13:29 - Richie: Logistics Regression
Linear Regression
😄
12/31/19, 13:29 - Richie: Oya @obinna drop your own😉
12/31/19, 13:29 - Richie: Yes
12/31/19, 13:30 - +234 809 440 5059: I have basic Knowledge of Python. Guess I have a teacher
12/31/19, 13:30 - +234 706 900 2818: Descriptive Analytics
Tools: Excel and Power BI
12/31/19, 13:31 - +234 806 351 4863: This message was deleted
12/31/19, 13:31 - +234 809 440 5059: My knowledge of Excel is close to Developer Knowledge🤣
12/31/19, 13:32 - +234 809 440 5059: You havn't told us what you are good at
12/31/19, 13:32 - AcidiQ: Descriptive and Predictive Analysis

Tools: Python, SQL, Excel, Plotly Dash, Power BI (Still perfecting this).
12/31/19, 13:32 - +234 706 900 2818: Come and teach us o, and duplicate yourself 😂
12/31/19, 13:33 - AcidiQ: Mad o!
12/31/19, 13:33 - +234 909 964 9854: From my point of view sha , in the next few years , busines intelligence will kick out auditors and financial accountants and will be the new fuel for business consulting
12/31/19, 13:33 - Richie: So macros and vba are babies to you.. Mad o
12/31/19, 13:34 - +234 809 440 5059: Forget, Its nothing much.
When you get to developer level, you'll be lazy to work in Excel Sheet.
But if you wanna do something just once you do on sheets.
But if its, going to be repeated like a report, you write Scripts for it in VBA and run it every time you need it
12/31/19, 13:36 - +234 809 440 5059: Nothing there na...
*Macro* is just a recording of all your actions  from beginning to the end.

*VBA* is the programmer side of Excel where you edit the recording to that it is re-usable for all other stuff
12/31/19, 13:37 - +234 909 964 9854: You can even do regression with power bi
12/31/19, 13:37 - +234 909 964 9854: Please holla @ me if u are down for the new movement of business analysis
12/31/19, 13:37 - +234 703 235 3516: Trained Statistician. 
Use Powerbi, Excel, R very well. Learning Python. And a machine learning/AI enthusiast.
12/31/19, 13:38 - +234 809 440 5059: So you know R, you are now looking for SQL again?
12/31/19, 13:39 - +234 703 235 3516: Lols....never too much.
12/31/19, 13:39 - +234 706 900 2818: The next employer might request for both...🌚
12/31/19, 13:39 - +234 703 235 3516: You are in the spirit.
12/31/19, 13:40 - +234 703 235 3516: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/31/19, 13:41 - Richie: The request rating of empoyer for data science positions it something else... They expect you to know everything... They want one person to do the whole team work
12/31/19, 13:43 - +234 909 964 9854: Power bi , Python , sql , data mining , AI are all tools to get you there , 
The real milk is business understanding 
Business requirements analysis 
Business process engineering
12/31/19, 13:44 - +234 703 235 3516: Honestly they need to be enlightened that a Data Scientist is different from a Data Analyst. A Data Analyst is different from a BI Analyst.
A data Engineer is not same as a Data Scientist.
12/31/19, 13:44 - +234 809 440 5059: It Ignorance
12/31/19, 13:44 - +234 809 440 5059: And they don't know that its dangerous
12/31/19, 13:45 - +234 703 235 3516: Very very dangerous.
12/31/19, 13:45 - +234 809 440 5059: Let me search my achieve to see what a friend in India replied me with when asked the difference btw all those jobs
12/31/19, 13:46 - +234 909 964 9854: Apart from data engineers, any analyst or scientists without good business acumen is just wasting his/her time
12/31/19, 13:47 - +234 809 440 5059: That is my own core,
I am a business analyst
12/31/19, 13:47 - +234 703 235 3516: I tell you.
12/31/19, 13:48 - +234 809 440 5059: Sorry to Engineers wey come do analyst, they better learn more to be a Scientist. Me, am not planning to be a Scientist at all.
12/31/19, 13:48 - +234 703 235 3516: Lols.....
12/31/19, 13:48 - +234 809 440 5059: <Media omitted>
12/31/19, 13:49 - +234 809 440 5059: Check the picture i just sent
12/31/19, 13:50 - +234 809 440 5059: An Analyst is to do only Engineering of Data which is *ETL* then do Analysts and Visualization. Thats all!
12/31/19, 13:51 - +234 909 964 9854: But what’s is the point of the analysis and visualization if it’s out of touch with business needs
12/31/19, 13:52 - +234 809 440 5059: As an analyst, you have to be Business Minded, esle what are you analyzing?
12/31/19, 13:52 - +234 909 964 9854: As analysts , don’t be engrossed on d tools , do more with business consulting
12/31/19, 13:53 - +234 909 964 9854: That’s where the new generation of analysts are heading to
12/31/19, 13:53 - +234 806 654 2723: This group is hot with ideas
12/31/19, 13:53 - +234 809 440 5059: But you need to know how to use the tools.
12/31/19, 13:53 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: This is great, but overtime, there will be a thin line between the descriptions
12/31/19, 13:53 - +234 806 654 2723: Remember we the babies and up upcoming
12/31/19, 13:54 - +234 809 440 5059: Well, I once met a lady that is also very good with Macros and VBA.

She said she doesn't care about Programming Languages or Query Languages or DataBases.
12/31/19, 13:55 - +234 703 235 3516: I totally agree.
12/31/19, 13:55 - +234 909 964 9854: Yes but the consulting is more , don’t be surprised when somebody that knows just excel will deliver more business insight than someone that knows all the the programming languages for analysis on earth
12/31/19, 13:56 - +234 809 440 5059: She said all she needs is the Data that she'll use normal Excel or Tableau to do her analysis and the Board of Directors still respects her
12/31/19, 13:56 - +234 809 440 5059: Exactly what I wanna say...
12/31/19, 13:56 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Create value. Periodt.
12/31/19, 13:57 - +234 809 440 5059: 👍🏼
12/31/19, 13:57 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: If someone else comes along that can create more value, accept that, learn and integrate. The future will come no matter how long you delay it lol
12/31/19, 13:58 - +234 703 235 3516: 👌👌....
12/31/19, 13:58 - +234 809 440 5059: It will become over syllabus...
And Nigerian companies will not pay.
12/31/19, 13:58 - +234 909 964 9854: Exactly, where is she abeg , I need to find her
12/31/19, 13:58 - +234 809 440 5059: They may even become scared to employ such person
12/31/19, 13:59 - +234 703 235 3516: It's not in the tool, it's in the valuable insight you can draw from using the tool.
12/31/19, 13:59 - +234 703 235 3516: Haha Haha....then you can relocate to the Abroad.
12/31/19, 13:59 - +234 809 440 5059: Na house I dey go meet Deborah o! Her Apple Lappy is connected to a 52inch screen.🤣
12/31/19, 14:00 - +234 809 440 5059: If e easy, I no go don commot...
Abi you think say I gbadu this country?
12/31/19, 14:00 - +234 809 440 5059: 😭😭😭
12/31/19, 14:02 - +234 703 235 3516: Just yesterday, a potential employer reached out, I made my expectations known(Salary). His response was that even the manager I will be reporting to, does not get so much.🤷‍♀🤷‍♀.
12/31/19, 14:02 - +234 809 440 5059: Imagine such....
12/31/19, 14:04 - +234 809 440 5059: I was working with Group Head of a Commercial Bank as an Business Intelligence Analyst...

Salary was part of the reason we part ways.
12/31/19, 14:04 - +234 703 235 3516: I tell you. After he had initially told me, he can sense pride in my discussion.
12/31/19, 14:05 - +234 809 440 5059: 🤣😂
12/31/19, 14:06 - +234 703 235 3516: When you are confident about what you can deliver and your employer took it for pride, only for him to tell you your demand is way more than their managers demand.
12/31/19, 14:07 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 😅😅

Na intimidate you intimidate am
12/31/19, 14:07 - +234 703 235 3516: I tell you.
12/31/19, 14:07 - +234 809 440 5059: What annoys me...
They whole some people to high esteem, I will be correcting errors from those ones.
12/31/19, 14:07 - +234 909 964 9854: 😆😆😆😆
12/31/19, 14:07 - +234 703 235 3516: Lols....
12/31/19, 14:09 - +234 909 964 9854: 😆😆😆😆😆😆
12/31/19, 14:16 - +234 809 440 5059: Sincerely, its not funny.

Reports sent by Business Managers...
Checking to be sure that the reports are correct especially numbers ain't always easy.

I did it manually twice and It took me half of the day. Then I sat at Mid-night to write VB code that will compare their reports with what's on Oracle database and also do number formatting so that the Group Head can just skim tru and send to the Line Executive director.
12/31/19, 14:16 - +234 809 440 5059: When you write write codes, you'll encounter errors. You have to debug...
12/31/19, 14:17 - +234 809 440 5059: Its not always easy to debug, infact thats what makes you a good programmer, DEBUGGING!
12/31/19, 14:18 - +234 809 440 5059: After taking the pain and time to do such stuff, somebody will now look down on me? Decide to pay me peanut or refuse to increase salary
12/31/19, 14:19 - +234 703 235 3516: It can be very frustrating actually......something as little as Data Entry. It's a big deal for some.
12/31/19, 14:19 - +234 703 235 3516: Hahahahaha.....
12/31/19, 14:20 - +234 806 079 8098: Well in as much as we want to deliver value. 
I think good negotiations on some terms and conditions might be considered. Options of remote work could be considered. 

Except one has work experience(s) of whether a Business Intelligence or data analyst or data scientists. I strongly feel accepting an offer between 150k -200k for such position is not too bad to have real time experience of what it takes to work in such position....
Because working on a real project at work is different from whatever knowledge we might have acquired during training or learning to become better.

Most employer might not want to pay much for just being a data analyst except u have some other skills set to solve their peculiar problem because everyone claims to be a data analyst even an excel user will tell u, they can do better than u do...
12/31/19, 14:24 - +234 703 235 3516: I feel you bro, the role was for a Sales Analyst that will draw insight on at least 200 Sku' s per week, from almost 100 sales Rep. And you have to be on the field to do some customer engagement for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation.
12/31/19, 14:25 - +234 806 079 8098: Understanding what value you want to deliver for what they are ready to offer is very key.

So, for a start that is fair enough and by the time you work for say 3-6 months. 

You are already an hot cake depending on projects you have executed while there!!!
And the continuous trainings or knowledge you have acquired
12/31/19, 14:25 - +234 806 079 8098: I will suggest you go back to the potential employer and renegotiate
12/31/19, 14:26 - +234 806 079 8098: Both of you can have a lunch appointment over this to understand what value u want to give and at what conditions of work you are willing to do it
12/31/19, 14:27 - +234 703 235 3516: 250k gross is too much??.
12/31/19, 14:27 - +234 806 079 8098: Sometimes in life we give to to receive....
12/31/19, 14:29 - +234 806 079 8098: If its too much for them ask what they can offer and what you can do for them too...

Sometimes taking a pay cut to develop one self in a chosen career is best for ones development.

Except you are already an expert in that field shaaaaa.
12/31/19, 14:29 - +234 909 964 9854: That’s why we need to create a team for strategic business consulting that will add more value to what we do , showcase our work out there and let them call us to solve their business problems with data
12/31/19, 14:29 - +234 809 440 5059: Guy i love what you did.
12/31/19, 14:30 - +234 909 964 9854: When business intelligence is , Kpmg and co Dey learn work
12/31/19, 14:30 - +234 809 440 5059: If we dont stand our ground....
This job of the future they are say, Nigeria will mess it up with peanut payment
12/31/19, 14:30 - +234 909 964 9854: Where*
12/31/19, 14:31 - +234 809 440 5059: Just the way HR firms turn 70% of Nigerian workforce to Contract staff
12/31/19, 14:31 - +234 806 079 8098: I think @2348062991199 is doing so much in that aspect and you could private chat him for how you can collaborate with him. There are some other guys out there too that do data analytics consulting. Except you want to take the bull by the horn and cave a niche for yourself in that area....
12/31/19, 14:32 - +234 909 964 9854: They will pay auditor that’s just to check whether debit and credit enter wella whereby bi guys can tell if the business will die tomorrow and what it needs to wake up
12/31/19, 14:33 - +234 909 964 9854: Thanks , I will buzz him
12/31/19, 14:33 - +234 809 440 5059: That why I said we need to put an end to that nonsense...
12/31/19, 14:34 - +234 703 235 3516: I tell you. Just 3M gross in a year, that can't even get you a very nice ride.🤣🤣🤣.
12/31/19, 14:35 - +234 806 079 8098: Lol
12/31/19, 14:36 - +234 909 964 9854: Can we get like a mail or a place whereby we can collate all the skills of everyone here , share it and create that solid team
12/31/19, 14:36 - +234 703 235 3516: Imagine.
12/31/19, 14:37 - +234 809 440 5059: The CEO of BlueChip is a Data Scientist trained abroad, worked for MTN for less than a year, resigned because he felt he was been underpaid. Firstbank tried to employ him he asked if they can pay 25million per month.

They sat tight
12/31/19, 14:37 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Auditors are bosses o. The amount of financial reporting standards and procedures in their heads no be here o. It's just unfortunate the processes are mostly manual
12/31/19, 14:37 - AcidiQ: Lol, as much as we all want to get nice rides and stuff I believe money should not be the driving force behind our work.

We should aim to solve problems peculiar to the business or firm you find yourself. Trust me the money will naturally follow.
12/31/19, 14:39 - +234 909 964 9854: They are just to ensure that the books are in conformity with the accounting standards that’s all , they are not far from data engineers that ensure that data conform with analysis standards
12/31/19, 14:39 - +234 703 235 3516: Hehehehe......you know the cost of training abroad is free.🤣
12/31/19, 14:39 - +234 806 079 8098: @2348062991199  I think @2349099649854 raised a good point here for consideration. Is it something, you would love to do?
12/31/19, 14:39 - AcidiQ: Some firms might abuse your work and pay you peanuts but at the end of the day, you'll grow to a point where better offers would chase you.
12/31/19, 14:40 - Richie: Standing your ground sometimes doesn't means to stand on both feet...use a warrior strategy...
A case example of Adof hilter.....

You think because you know ABC you should be paid xyz.. Yes correct but that's the same thing people thought starting a business will give them 3m in few months..... Calm down you will earn big later
12/31/19, 14:41 - +234 703 235 3516: Bro, if money were to be the force, maybe I will be asking for  at least 500k. I am in for anything value. Infact it's a crime to get paid, for a value you can't offer. But a level is comfort is required for you to deliver. Take it or leave it, there are bills to be paid.
12/31/19, 14:42 - +234 703 235 3516: *of
12/31/19, 14:43 - +234 809 440 5059: All those standards na inside book, how many comes to play?
All the standards can be hard coded into just one script.

I stylishly mocked the Regional Control Compliance Officer where i was before, for there bureaucratic style despite having laptops and Excel to work with. I told him everything the auditors sit to do in a day, I will use one script to run audit and get my findings withing 5mins.
 The man got the message and told me that my brain is still fresh thats why I can load all those IT stuff in my brain. That when they were young they had no computers no programming available.
12/31/19, 14:44 - +234 703 235 3516: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/31/19, 14:44 - +234 809 440 5059: 🤣😂
12/31/19, 14:44 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Chai
12/31/19, 14:44 - +234 909 964 9854: Exactly my point bro
12/31/19, 14:44 - +234 809 440 5059: Na the bank value them more than ana Analyst that can see future
12/31/19, 14:45 - +234 809 440 5059: That shit
12/31/19, 14:45 - AcidiQ: Yea true talk. That's where compromise comes in.

Since you've compromised and reduced your salary demands to as low as can go and the firm feels they can't pay, you have nothing to worry about.

Better offers will always come.
12/31/19, 14:46 - +234 809 440 5059: We need to reject all this treatment, else we wont be able to practice what we learnt with sleepless nights
12/31/19, 14:46 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Yep yep. We can work on it. 

If not for the Open Analytics platform, then for skills outsourcing. Great stuff
12/31/19, 14:46 - +234 909 964 9854: I designed a dynamic aging report on power bi that took people 7 days to prepared
12/31/19, 14:46 - +234 703 235 3516: Definitely.
12/31/19, 14:46 - Richie: See at the end that guy lost the job... And someone took the job... Its your opinion at the end....do what works for you... If you want to be paid 1m fine.. If you will start woth 150 fine...

No need for all this content and fact we are raising...
12/31/19, 14:47 - +234 909 964 9854: And I could even do more with the debtors days to ascertain the chances of a debt being bad
12/31/19, 14:48 - AcidiQ: See how you just reduced someone's career to one line of code😫

Mad o!
12/31/19, 14:48 - +234 703 235 3516: 🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀
12/31/19, 14:49 - +234 809 440 5059: We are in the future...
We should be employed to train those auditor on how to be more efficient
12/31/19, 14:49 - +234 706 811 1035: I disagree with you.Data analyst work is totally different from that of Accountants and Auditors. But what I think is that, Accountants and Auditors also need to equip themselves with data analysis skills for them to be able to  add more value to business in the nearest future.
12/31/19, 14:49 - +234 909 964 9854: 😂😂😂😂😂
12/31/19, 14:50 - +234 809 440 5059: But NO, they value them because those ones have shown long list of certifications that Nigeria will never be in a  position for them to display the knowledge.
12/31/19, 14:51 - Richie: No jx that bro...
Wait a minute....

Data analyst in the house how many of you can do financial modelling 💁‍♂
12/31/19, 14:51 - +234 809 440 5059: I like Analytics because no be by certificate. You will be given space and time to display your skills.

Banks are still reading list of certificate😂🤣
12/31/19, 14:51 - +234 809 440 5059: 🖐
12/31/19, 14:52 - AcidiQ: Yea facts. Majority of Nigeria's workforce need to up-skill/re-skill themselves.
12/31/19, 14:52 - +234 809 440 5059: Have a job for me?
12/31/19, 14:52 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: 😅 Script that you can spend a few days writing and debugging abi?

Be careful o, cuz an auditor with BI knowledge is a sure guy
12/31/19, 14:52 - Richie: So is it part of data analysis??
12/31/19, 14:52 - +234 809 440 5059: No
12/31/19, 14:53 - +234 809 440 5059: I learnt that because i wanna know😂
12/31/19, 14:53 - +234 909 964 9854: Tell me something an account does that cannot be coded
12/31/19, 14:53 - +234 909 964 9854: Accountant*
12/31/19, 14:53 - +234 909 964 9854: The best match are management accountants and they are not far from business analysts
12/31/19, 14:53 - +234 909 964 9854: They are as good as data engineers, simple
12/31/19, 14:54 - Richie: So you see why data analysis or data science is not everything....

Your combination of data science and your field od study makes data science interesting....

So leave auditor or accountant alone 😄
12/31/19, 14:55 - +234 706 811 1035: I disagree with you. Data analyst work is different from that of Accountants and Auditors. What I just think is that Accountants and Auditors also need to equip themselves with data analysis skills for them to be  able to add more value to business in the nearest future.
12/31/19, 14:55 - +234 809 440 5059: They can't be kicked out.
Software will only be deployed to make their work faster.
Their job is different
12/31/19, 14:55 - +234 809 440 5059: They are the resident Police of any organisation
12/31/19, 14:55 - Richie: You are joking 🤣🤣🤣
12/31/19, 14:56 - +234 706 811 1035: Exactly
12/31/19, 14:56 - +234 909 964 9854: Or software plus AI will do the work
12/31/19, 14:56 - +234 909 964 9854: It’s no brainer , just bunch of rules
12/31/19, 14:56 - +234 809 440 5059: An analyst will not see, how an amount was spent and if actually it was spent on what its meant for

But auditors will see it.

I just hate their manual way of life
12/31/19, 14:57 - +234 706 811 1035: Data analysis software only does not make one a good business advisor.
12/31/19, 14:58 - +234 909 964 9854: Yeah too manual
12/31/19, 14:58 - +234 809 440 5059: The human part, can not be over emphasized.
AI may reduce auditors from 10 to 2 but will never erase that function.
12/31/19, 14:59 - +234 909 964 9854: Even fraud that is the major reason for auditors can be dealt with by data analysts like nothing
12/31/19, 15:01 - +234 909 964 9854: Yeah the two are the people that coded the AI 😂😂😂😂
12/31/19, 15:04 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I agree.

You can use the budget data for sample analysis. I've been reluctant to post some findings 😅
12/31/19, 15:05 - AcidiQ: <Media omitted>
12/31/19, 15:06 - Richie: 🤣... As in
12/31/19, 15:07 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: No better way to communicate this 👌🏽
12/31/19, 15:07 - +234 809 440 5059: Its a human that will control the drone...
12/31/19, 15:07 - +234 909 964 9854: Yeah I am sure u brought in other data like population census or so
12/31/19, 15:07 - +234 809 440 5059: Sorry guys,
12/31/19, 15:08 - +234 809 440 5059: GAT TO RUN OFF NOW...

WORK TO BE DONE.
12/31/19, 15:08 - +234 809 440 5059: 🏃🏽‍♂🏃🏽‍♂🏃🏽‍♂🏃🏽‍♂
12/31/19, 15:10 - +234 703 235 3516: Job has just changed hands, funniest thing is he won't be paid as much as the pilot. 🤣🤣. It's cheaper and more effective.
12/31/19, 15:12 - +234 706 811 1035: This said it all.
But I think a Chartered Accountant with strong data analysis skills will be a nice  one.
12/31/19, 15:14 - +234 816 468 6604: 😅 true
12/31/19, 15:14 - +234 703 235 3516: While the pilot might have lost his Job, The camera guy could retain his, if he had upgraded his skill to stay relevant.
12/31/19, 15:15 - +234 806 654 2723: U can have the data but an accountant will explain why those figures are what they are
12/31/19, 15:16 - AcidiQ: So the summary of the whole story is just two words:

Upgrade yourself.
12/31/19, 15:17 - +234 706 811 1035: 👍👍
12/31/19, 15:17 - +234 703 235 3516: 👌👌
12/31/19, 15:17 - +234 703 235 3516: Upgrade yourself to stay relevant.
12/31/19, 15:21 - +234 706 811 1035: And I think this platform is actually a great place to collaborate and do some nice works.We have brilliant Data analysts,Accoutants and other professionals on this platform.I am a Charterd Accountant and ready to work with other professionals on this platform on value-adding projects.
12/31/19, 15:26 - +234 909 964 9854: Great 👍

12/31/19, 17:32 - +234 806 654 2723: We accountant should embrace IT so that how work can be precise and more accurate
12/31/19, 19:38 - +234 809 837 4664: Data analysis using Eviews, SPSS, Stata, and Excel. Any kind of statistical analysis is not a problem💯

1/3/20, 19:20 - +234 809 440 5059: Ranging from Skilled to Unskilled Labour

Most of the Skilled/White Sleeve Jobs give a document to show at embassy to speed up your visa or they do the processing for your from there... IF, YOU WERE SELECTED TO COME WORK WITH THEM.
1/3/20, 19:22 - Opeyemi Tosin: This will come at a price
1/3/20, 19:26 - Richie: Jx saw a post related to this
1/3/20, 19:50 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: My brother why you dey japa?
1/3/20, 20:22 - +234 703 275 3450: Boss.
Please I'm interested
1/4/20, 01:46 - +234 809 440 5059: Alot of things are discouraging here.
1/4/20, 01:49 - +234 809 440 5059: @2348062991199 Do you know that in Nigeria now, it a crime to have your looks (beard)?
Then it'll confirm to SARS that one is one of the people they are looking for when they now see a LAPTOP with you.
Don't try to show them an ID, they won't listen
1/4/20, 01:53 - +234 809 440 5059: A Nigeria that works with SWAT abroad, come home for holiday and was harassed by this SARS people. The guy wished he had his gun with him, the 8 of them them would have been buried by now. The guy said it does not take him more than 24hrs to terminate the IG of police and he does not need to be there; a drone will do the job. Those were his last sentence before he left Nigeria.
1/4/20, 02:06 - +234 809 440 5059: Again, you see the way thing are going, public officials mal-handling and squandering our funds, Nigeria isn't producing anything; that are sign that we are never gonna develop.

Unemployment everywhere, I went through a job package abroad meant for someone whose only required skill is Advance Excel and VBA, thats all. I wanted to cry!

This is a skill Nigeria never knew exist of never saw reason to align with.

An acclaimed HR Group Head in Nigeria with numerous certifications will list the skilled of a Data Scientist for just a Project Analyst.

List the skills of a System Engineer for an Information Technologist

Mistaken the skills of a Full Programmer an ordinary Front End Web DevOps

And they'll be bragging about it saying they have been practicing HR for 25yrs, 30yrs🤣🤣

I just tire!
1/4/20, 06:23 - +234 706 900 2818: I wonder a lot when I see the job requirements for a lot of tech jobs. 
Do these people really know what they are doing?
The HRs I think are trying to suit their employers. Get someone who can do 10 things for the price of 1. And this makes me cringe a lot.
On the flip side, this has allowed us to be versatile, but it also steals our ability to create and innovate effectively.
The hope for a better Nigeria is always looking like a mirage.
If we've got the opportunity to better our lives somewhere else, it's no crime. After all, all our so called leaders can run anywhere anytime.
1/4/20, 06:51 - AcidiQ: The future looks bleak for Nigeria. I'm an optimist and as much as I'll love to say "E go better", I'll just be playing to the gallery and wallowing in self-deceit.

The employment space in Nigeria has a lot of fundamental issues. From meagre pay to companies advertising for jobs that they don't even understand the job description. Most companies don't even know what they want, they list requirements for a job and expect 1 person to have the skills of an entire Data science team.

The short-term goal is to get a job (bills need to be paid) but long-term we should think about creating our own businesses and changing the tech space in Nigeria.

Fact is: The best companies in Nigeria 🇳🇬 are yet to be founded.
If you have the chance to jakpa, seize it. Go out there, learn all you can and possibly come back and contribute your own quota to our budding tech industry.

All the best Fam!
1/4/20, 07:11 - +234 809 440 5059: No, not in all cases. You may say 1 out of 20 cases is trying to get the best hand for the client; But the rest is IGNORANCE.
1/4/20, 07:13 - +234 809 440 5059: They don't know what it entails, they just go through Google search, see what other mediocre HR people like them have written, then adopt it.

And the rubbish keeps trending.
1/4/20, 07:18 - +234 809 440 5059: NO CERTIFICATE can make you a SCIENTIST or an ANALYST...

You have to earn it by EXPERIENCE.
The output of your work must have been consumed by TOP MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS and SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. They are only one that can grade you on how your work has impacted business(es).
1/4/20, 07:24 - +234 809 440 5059: If i'm asked...
Inside the Job of a Data Analyst there some other sub-jobs like
~Dash Board Designer
~Data Modeler 
~Data Entry Officer
~VBA expert 
etc...

A Data Analyst will become better by the day on the job. Some that has not laid hands on official projects to test his ability in Analytic and gain experience will rush to start doing ML and AI.

At the become jack of all trade, never better at a single one.
1/4/20, 07:27 - +234 816 249 9900: You people should publish an article
1/4/20, 07:27 - +234 816 249 9900: It probably will go viral

tinyurl.com/qpw8cql look at it yourself
1/4/20, 07:34 - +234 706 900 2818: I remember in 2018. I had no direction in this field of analytics. I was learning python, machine learning, excel, tableau, power bi, and unfortunately for me, my learning was so unstructured, and I was completely worse off, than I started. 
After a sober reflection, I observed that I shouldn't be so crazy about the tools, but to understand the working and process of an analytics project, and just get my hands dirty with something real.
My boss has really been of help, by also providing me the opportunity to handle some projects at work.

1/6/20, 18:48 - +234 706 900 2818: Hello all,
Please how do you go about the issue of wide data gap in visualization?
For instance, I want to show number of suicides per country, while majority of the values for most countries are in hundreds, countries like China, India are having data in thousands, and tens of thousands.
How do you go about scaling this on your axis?
1/6/20, 18:53 - Opeyemi Tosin: What type of visualisation are you using!
1/6/20, 18:54 - +234 809 440 5059: Which visual are u using?
1/6/20, 18:54 - Opeyemi Tosin: This message was deleted
1/6/20, 18:54 - Opeyemi Tosin: I will advise you use a Scatter plot and make the x-axis logarithmic scale.
1/6/20, 18:55 - +234 706 900 2818: A line chart, cos it's over a period
1/6/20, 18:56 - Opeyemi Tosin: You will also need the country's population for the size of the bubble.
1/6/20, 18:59 - +234 806 222 9997: Line chart wouldn't be the best as far power BI is concerned, Tableau could have done synced dual visualisation to make it look appreciable but not Power BI in that regard. Better to use scatter plot like @2348110895622 rightly said.
1/6/20, 19:04 - +234 809 440 5059: He may need country population
1/6/20, 19:05 - Opeyemi Tosin: Yeah...
Tableau will handle it seemlessly. You can handle add a year filter and play the visualisation to see the trend per year. I dunno if PowerBI latest update was enhanced to handle this type of visualisation (bubble size increase per country's population).
1/6/20, 19:08 - +234 806 222 9997: Yeah, most likely. Or it depends. It depends on what he wants to bring out. 
Data in the hands of an analyst is up to him what he wants to paint.
I don't know the source of his data, but I have got a data like this time past to do stuffs with, I abandoned it later, I think based on many missing data or something. 
But like I said, where I got mine could be different from his.
1/6/20, 19:09 - +234 706 900 2818: Yeah, population as well... it tells the story more
1/6/20, 19:09 - +234 706 900 2818: This was from gapminder.com
It was surprising there was no missing data
1/6/20, 19:10 - +234 706 900 2818: Much noted...Thanks
1/6/20, 19:11 - +234 806 222 9997: Ohh! That's good.
Missing data comes with its own horror, especially where you can't suggest it by some reasonable statistical methods
1/6/20, 19:11 - +234 806 222 9997: You are welcome
1/6/20, 21:46 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: I would advise a log scale too

Scatter plot or line chart, it's up to you and the dimensions of data you have.
1/6/20, 22:59 - +234 706 900 2818: Thanks boss
1/6/20, 23:21 - Oluwatobi Williams RESAGRATIA: Good evening house,

1/7/20, 05:13 - +234 806 654 2723: I am a chartered accountant
1/7/20, 09:19 - +234 706 811 1035: I am
